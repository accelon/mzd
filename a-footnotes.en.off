^fn1 A comprador, in the original sense of the word, was the Chinese manages or the senior Chinese employee in a foreign commercial establishment. 
The compradors served foreign economic interests and bad close connection with imperialism and foreign capital.
^fn2 The Étatistes were a handful of shameless fascist politicians who at that time formed the Chinese Étatiste Youth League, later renamed the Chinese Youth Party. 
They made counter-revolutionary careers for themselves by opposing the Communist Party and the Soviet Union and received subsidies from the various groups of reactionaries in power and from the imperialists.
^fn3 For further discussion of the role of the national bourgeoisie, see "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party", Chapter 2, Section 4, , Vol. II.
^fn4 Tai Chi-tao joined the Kuomintang in his youth and for a time was Chiang Kai-shek's partner in stock exchange speculation. 
After Sun Yat-sen's death in 1925 he carried on anti-Communist agitation and prepared the ground ideologically for Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary coup d'état in 1927. 
For years be was a faithful running dog to Chiang Kai-shek in the counter-revolution. 
He committed suicide in February 1949, driven to despair by the imminent doom of Chiang Kai-shek's regime.
^fn5 The Chen Pao was the organ of the Association for the Study of Constitutional Government, a political group which supported the rule of the Northern warlords.
^fn6 In 1923 Sun Yat-sen, with the help of the Chinese Communist Party, decided to reorganize the Kuomintang bring about Kuomintang-Communist co-operation and admit members of the Communist Party into the Kuomintang. 
In January 1924 he convened in Canton the Kuomintang's First National Congress at which he laid down the Three Great Policies--alliance with Russia, co-operation with the Communist Party and assistance to the peasants and workers. 
Mao Tse-tung, Li Ta-chao, Lin Po-chu, Chu Chiu-pai and other comrades attended the Congress and played an important part in helping the Kuomintang to take the road of revolution. 
Some of these comrades were elected members, and others alternate members, of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang.
^fn7 By owner-peasants Comrade Mao Tse-tung means the middle peasants.
^fn8 Marshal Chao is Chao Kung-ming, God of Wealth in Chinese folklore.
^fn9 The May 30th Movement was the nation-wide anti-imperialist movement in protest against the massacre of the Chinese people by the British police in Shanghai on May 30 1925. 
Earlier that month, major strikes had broken out in Japanese-owned textile mills in Tsingtao and Shanghai, which the Japanese imperialists and the Northern warlords who were their running dogs proceeded to suppress. 
On May 15 the Japanese textile mill-owners in Shanghai shot and killed the worker Ku Cheng-hung and wounded a dozen others. 
On May 28 eight workers were slaughtered by the reactionary government in Tsingtao. 
On May 30 more than two thousand students in Shanghai agitated in the foreign concessions in support of the workers and for the recovery of the foreign concessions. 
They rallied more than ten thousand people before the British police headquarters, shouting such slogans as "Down with imperialism!" and "People of China, unite!" The British imperialist police opened fire, killing and wounding many students. 
This became known as the May 30th Massacre. 
It immediately aroused country-wide indignation, and demonstrations and strikes of workers, students and shopkeepers were held everywhere, forming a tremendous anti-imperialist movement.
^fn10 By "the overwhelming majority of the semi-owner peasants", Comrade Mao Tse-tung is here referring to the impoverished peasants who worked partly on their own land and partly on land rented from others.
^fn11 There were several strata of shop assistants in old China. 
Here Comrade Mao Tse-tung is referring to the largest. 
There was also the lower stratum of shop assistants who led the life of proletarians.
^fn12 The seamen's strikes were staged by the seamen at Hongkong and by the crews of the Yangtse River steamers early in 1922. 
The Hongkong seamen held out for eight weeks. 
After a bitter and bloody struggle, the British imperialist authorities in Hongkong were finally forced to raise wages, lift the ban on the Seamen's Union, release the arrested workers and indemnify the families of the martyrs. 
The crews of the Yangtze steamers went on strike soon afterwards, carried on the struggle for two weeks and also won victory.
^fn13 Immediately after its founding in 1922-23 the Chinese Communist Party set about organizing the railway worker. 
In 1922-23 strikes took place under the Party's leadership on all the trunk lines. 
The best known was the general strike on the Peking-Hankow Railway which began on February 4, 1923. 
It was a fight for the freedom to organize a general trade union. 
On February 7 the Northern warlords Wu Pei-fu and Hsiao Yao-nan, who were backed by British imperialism, butchered the strikers. 
This became known as the February 7th Massacre.
^fn14 The Kailan Coal Mines was an inclusive name for the large contiguous Kaiping and Luanchow coalfields in Hopei Province, then employing over fifty thousand workers. 
During the Yi Ho Tuan Movement of 1900 the British imperialists seized the Kaiping mines. 
Subsequently the Chinese organized the Luanchow Coal Mining Company, which was later incorporated into the Kailan Mining Administration. 
Both coalfields thus came under the exclusive control of British imperialism. 
The Kailan strike took place in October 1922. 
The Tsiaotso Coal Mines, situated in Honan Province, are also well known in China. 
The Tsiaotso strike lasted from July 1 to August 9, 1925
^fn15 Shameen, a section of the city of Canton, was held on lease by British imperialism. 
In July 1924 the British imperialists who ruled it issued a new police regulation requiring all Chinese to produce passes with photos on leaving or entering the area. 
But foreigners were exempt. 
On July 15 the workers in Shameen went on strike to protest against this preposterous measure, which the British imperialists were finally forced to cancel.
^fn16 Following the May 30th Incident in Shanghai, general strikes broke out on June 1, 1925 in Shanghai and on June 19 in Hongkong. 
More than 200,000 workers took part in Shanghai and 250,000 in Hongkong. 
The big Hongkong strike, with the support of the people throughout the country, lasted sixteen months. 
It was the longest strike in the history of the world labour movement.
^fn17 Chihli was the old name for Hopei Province.
^fn18 The Triad Society, the Society of Brothers, the Big Sword Society, the Rational Life Society and the Green Band were primitive secret organizations among the people. 
The members were mainly bankrupt peasants, unemployed handicraftsmen and other lumpen-proletarians. 
In feudal China these elements were often drawn together by come religion or superstition to form organizations of a patriarchal pattern and bearing different names and some possessed arms. 
Through these organizations the lumpen-proletarians sought to help each other socially and economically, and sometimes fought the bureaucrats and landlords who oppressed them. 
Of course, such backward organizations could not provide a way out for the peasants and handicraftsmen. 
Furthermore, they could easily be controlled and utilized by the landlords and local tyrants and, because of this and of their blind destructiveness, come turned into reactionary forces. 
In his counter-revolutionary coup d'etat of 1927 Chiang Kai-shek made use of them to disrupt the unity of the labouring people and destroy the revolution. 
As the modern industrial proletariat arose and grew from strength to strength, the peasants, under the leadership of the working class, gradually formed themselves into organizations of an entirely new type, and these primitive, backward societies lost their raison d'etre.

^fn1 Hunan Province was then the centre of the peasant movement in China.
^fn2 Chao Heng-ti, the ruler of Hunan at the time, was the agent of the Northern warlords. 
He was overthrown by the Northern Expeditionary Army in 1926.
^fn3 The Revolution of 1911 overthrew the autocratic regime of the Ching Dynasty. 
On October lo of that year, a section of the Ching Dynasty's New Army staged an uprising in Wuchang, Hupeh Province, at the urging of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois revolutionary societies. 
It was followed by uprisings in other provinces, and very soon the rule of the Ching Dynasty crumbled. 
On January 1, 1912, the Provisional Government of the Republic of China was set up in Nanking, and Sun Yat-sen was elected Provisional President. 
The revolution achieved victory through the alliance of the bourgeoisie with the peasants, workers and urban petty bourgeoisie. 
But state power fell into the hands of the Northern warlord Yuan Shih-kai, and the revolution failed, because the group which led it was conciliationist in nature, failed to give real benefits to the peasants and yielded to imperialist and feudal pressure.
^fn4 These were the virtues of Confucius, as described by one of his disciples.
^fn5 The old Chinese phrase, "exceeding the proper limits in righting a wrong", was often quoted for the purpose of restricting people's activities, reforms that remained within the framework of the established order were to be permitted, but activities aiming at the complete destruction of the old order were to be forbidden Actions within this framework were regarded as "proper", but those that aimed at completely destroying the old order were described as "exceeding the proper limits". 
It is a convenient doctrine for reformists and opportunists in the revolutionary ranks. 
Comrade Mao Tse-tung refuted this kind of reformist doctrine.
His remark in the text that "Proper limits have to be exceeded in order to right a wrong, or else the wrong cannot be righted" meant that the mass revolutionary method, and not the revisionist-reformist method, had to be taken to end the old feudal order.
^fn6 Chiang Kai-shek had not yet been fully exposed as a counter-revolutionary in the winter of 1926 and the spring of 1927 when the Northern Expeditionary Army was marching into the Yangtze valley, and the peasant masses still thought that he was for the revolution. 
The landlords and rich peasants disliked him and spread the rumour that the Northern Expeditionary Army had suffered defeats and that he had been wounded in the leg. 
Chiang Kai-shek came to be fully revealed as a counter-revolutionary on April 12, 1927, when he staged his counter-revolutionary coup d'état in Shanghai and elsewhere, massacring the workers, suppressing the peasants and attacking the Communist Party. 
The landlords and rich peasants then changed their attitude and began to support him.
^fn7 Kwangtung was the first revolutionary base in the period of the First Revolutionary Civil War (1924-27).
^fn8 Wu Pei-fu was one of the best-known of the Northern warlords. 
Together with Tsao Kun, who was notorious for his rigging of the presidential election in 1923 by bribing members of parliament, he belonged to the Chihli (Hopei) clique. 
He supported Tsao as the leader and the two were generally referred to as "Tsao-Wu". 
In 1920 after defeating Tuan Chi-jui, warlord of the Anhwei clique, Wu Pei-fu gained control of the Northern warlord government in Peking as an agent of the Anglo-American imperialists; it was he who gave the orders for the massacre, on February 7, 1923, of the workers on strike along the Peking-Hankow Railway. 
In 1924 he was defeated in the war with Chang Tso-lin (commonly known as the "war between the Chihli and Fengtien cliques"), and he was thereupon ousted from the Peking regime. 
In 1926 he joined forces with Chang Tso-lin at the instigation of the Japanese and British imperialists, and thus returned to power. 
When the Northern Expeditionary Army drove northward from Kwangtung in 1926, he was the first foe to be overthrown.
^fn9 The Three People's Principles were Sun Yat-sen's principles and programme for the bourgeois-democratic revolution in China on the questions of nationalism, democracy and people's livelihood. 
In 1924, in the Manifesto of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang, Sun Yat-sen restated the Three People's Principles, interpreting nationalism as opposition to imperialism and expressing active support for the movements of the workers and peasants. 
The old Three People's Principles thus developed into the new, consisting of the Three Great Policies, that is, alliance with Russia, co-operation with the Communist Party, and assistance to the peasants and workers. 
The new Three People's Principles provided the political basis for co-operation between the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang during the First Revolutionary Civil War period.
^fn10 The Chinese term for "long live" is wansui, literally "ten thousand years", and was the traditional salute to the emperor; it had become a synonym for "emperor".
^fn11 Rich peasants should not have been allowed to join the peasant associations, a point which the peasant masses did not yet understand in 1927.
^fn12 Here the "utterly destitute" means the farm labourers (the rural proletariat) and the rural lumpen-proletariat.
^fn13 The "less destitute" means the rural semi-proletariat.
^fn14 Yuan Tsu-ming was a warlord of Kweichow Province who controlled the western part of Hunan.
^fn15 A tenant generally gave his landlord, as a condition of tenancy, a deposit in cash or kind, often amounting to a considerable part of the value of the land. 
Though this was supposed to be a guarantee for payment of rent, it actually represented a form of extra exploitation.
^fn16 In Hunan, the tu corresponded to the district and the tuan to the township The old administrations of the tu and the tuan type were instruments of landlord rule.
^fn17 The tax per mou was a surcharge on top of the regular lent tax, ruthlessly imposed on the peasants by the landlord regime.
^fn18 Under the regime of the Northern warlords, the military head of a province was called "military governor". 
But he was the virtual dictator of the province with administrative as well as military power gathered in his hands. 
In league with the imperialists, he maintained a separatist feudal-militarist regime in his locality.
^fn19 The "standing household militia" was one of the various kinds of armed forces in the countryside. 
The term "household" is used because some member of almost every household had to join it. 
After the defeat of the revolution in 1927 the landlords in many places seized control of the militia ant turned them into armed counter-revolutionary bands.
^fn20 At the time, many of the county headquarters of the Kuomintang. 
under the leadership of the Kuomintang's Central Executive Committee in Wuhan. 
pursued Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Great Policies of alliance with Russia, co-operation with the Communist Party and assistance to the peasants and workers. 
They constituted the revolutionary alliance of the Communists, the left-wingers of the Kuomintang and other revolutionaries.
^fn21 Lord Pao (Pao Cheng) was prefect of Kaifeng, capital of the Northern Sung Dynasty (AD 960-1127). 
He was famous in popular legend as an upright official and a fearless, impartial judge with a knack of passing true verdicts in all the cases he tried.
^fn22 This reference to archery is taken from Mencius. 
It describes how the expert teacher of archery draws his bow with a histrionic gesture but does not release the arrow. 
The point is that while Communists should guide the peasants in attaining a full measure of political consciousness, they should leave it to the peasants' own initiative to abolish superstitious and other bad practices, and should not give them orders or do it for them.
^fn23 The Eight Characters were a method of fortune-telling in China based on the examination of the two cyclic characters each for the year, month, day and hour of a person's birth respectively.
^fn24 Geomancy refers to the superstition that the location of one's ancestors' graves influences one's fortune. 
The geomancers claim to be able to tell whether a particular site and its surroundings are auspicious.
^fn25 Lord Kuan (Kuan Yu, AD 160-219), a warrior in the epoch of the Three Kingdoms, was widely worshipped by the Chinese as the God of Loyalty and War.
^fn26 Tang Sheng-chih was a general who sided with the revolution in the Northern Expedition. 
Yeh Kai-hsin was a general on the side of the Northern warlords who fought against the revolution.
^fn27 Sun Chuan-fang was a warlord whose rule extended over the five provinces of Kiangsu, Chekiang, Fukien, Kiangsi and Anhwei. 
He was responsible for the bloody suppression of the insurrections of the Shanghai workers. 
His main army was crushed in the winter of 1926 by the Northern Expeditionary Army in Nanchang and Kiukiang, Kiangsi Province.
^fn28 In China a dish is served in a bowl or a plate for the whole table, and not individually.
^fn29 "Oriental Culture" was a reactionary doctrine which rejected modern scientific civilization and favoured the preservation of the backward mode of agricultural production and the feudal culture of the Orient.
^fn30 For the secret societies, see "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society", Note 18, p. 21 of this volume.
^fn31 "Mountain", "lodge", "shrine" and "river" were names used by primitive secret societies to denote some of their sects.
^fn32 When Nanchang was captured by the Northern Expeditionary Army in November 1926, Chiang Kai-shek seized the opportunity to establish his general headquarters there. 
He gathered around himself the right-wing members of the Kuomintang and a number of Northern warlord politicians and, in collusion with the imperialists, hatched his counter-revolutionary plot against Wuhan, the then revolutionary centre. 
Eventually, on April 12, 1927, he staged his counter-revolutionary coup d'état which was marked by tremendous massacres in Shanghai.
^fn33 Chang Ching-chiang, a right-wing Kuomintang leader, was a member of Chiang Kai-shek's brain trust.
^fn34 Liu Yueh-chih was head of the "Left Society", an important anti-Communist group in Hunan.
^fn35 As told by Liu Hsiang (77-6 BC) in his Hsin Hsu, Lord Sheh was so fond of dragons that he adorned his whole palace with drawings and carvings of them. 
But when a real dragon heard of his infatuation and paid him a visit, he was frightened out of his wits. 
Here Comrade Mao Tse-tung uses this metaphor to show that though Chiang Kai-shek and his like talked about revolution, they were afraid of revolution and against it.
^c3
^fn1 By the term "bourgeoisie", Comrade Mao Tse-tung means the national bourgeoisie. 
For his detailed account of the distinction between this class and the big comprador bourgeoisie, see "On Tactics Against Japanese Imperialism" (December 1955) and "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" (December 1939
^fn2 These four cliques of warlords fought together against Chang Tso-lin and occupied Peking and Tientsin in June 1928
^fn3 Chang Tso-lin, who headed the Fengtien clique of warlords, became the most powerful warlord in northern China after defeating Wu Pei-fu in the second Chihli-Fengden War in 1924. 
In 1926, with Wu Pei-fu as his ally, he marched on and occupied Peking. 
In June 1928, while retreating to the Northeast by rail, he was killed en route by a bomb planted by the Japanese imperialists whose tool he had been.
^fn4 This reform movement arose after the Japanese invaders occupied Tsinan on May 3,1928, and after Chiang Kai-shek openly and brazenly compromised with Japan. 
Within the national bourgeoisie which had identified itself with the counter-revolutionary coup d'état of 1927, a section acting in its own interests gradually began to form an opposition to the Chiang Kai-shek regime. 
The careerist counter-revolutionary group of Wang Ching-wei, Chen Kung-po and others which was active in this movement formed what became known as the "Reorganization Clique" in the Kuomintang.
^fn5 In 1928 Chiang Kai-shek, backed by British and USA imperialism, drove north to attack Chang Tso-lin. 
The Japanese imperialists then occupied Tsinan, the provincial capital of Shantung, and cut the Tientsin-Pukow railway line to check the northward spread of British and American influence. 
On May 3 the invading Japanese troops slaughtered large numbers of Chinese in Tsinan. 
This became known as the Tsinan Massacre.
^fn6 The organizational form of China's Red political power was similar to that of Soviet political power. 
A Soviet is a representative council, a political institution created by the Russian working class during the 1905 Revolution. 
Lenin and Stalin, on the basis of Marxist theory, drew the conclusion that a Soviet republic is the most suitable form of social and political organization for the transition from capitalism to socialism. 
Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party of Lenin and Stalin, the Russian October Socialist Revolution in 1917 brought into being for the first time in world history such a socialist Soviet republic, a dictatorship of the proletariat. 
After the defeat of the 1927 revolution in China, the representative council was adopted as the form of people's political power in various places in the mass revolutionary uprisings led by the Chinese Communist Party and, first and foremost, by Comrade Mao Tse-tung. 
In its nature political power at that stage of the Chinese revolution was a people's democratic dictatorship of the anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, new-democratic revolution led by the proletariat, which was different from the proletarian dictatorship in the Soviet Union.
^fn7 During World War II, many colonial countries in the East formerly under the imperialist rule of Britain, the United States, Prance and the Netherlands were occupied by the Japanese imperialists. 
Led by their Communist Parties, the masses of workers, peasants and urban petty bourgeoisie and members of the national bourgeoisie in these countries took advantage of the contradictions between the British, USA, French and Dutch imperialists on the one hand and the Japanese imperialists on the other, organized a broad united from against fascist aggression, built anti-Japanese base areas and waged bitter guerrilla warfare against the Japanese. 
Thus the political situation existing prior to World War II began to change.
 When the Japanese imperialists were driven out of these countries at the end of World War II, the imperialists of the United States, Britain, France and the Netherlands attempted to restore their colonial rule, but, having built up armed forces of considerable strength during the and-Japanese war, these colonial peoples refused to return to the old way of life. 
Moreover, the imperialist system all over the world was profoundly shaken because the Soviet Union had become strong, because all the imperialist powers, except the United States, had either been overthrown or weakened in the war, and finally because the imperialist front was breached in China by the victorious Chinese revolution.
 Thus, much as in China, it has become possible for the peoples of all, or at least some, of the colonial countries in the East to maintain big and small revolutionary base areas and revolutionary regimes over a long period of time, and to carry on long-term revolutionary wars in which to surround the cities from the countryside, and then gradually to advance to take the cities and win nation-wide victory. 
The view held by Comrade Mao Tse-tung in 1928 on the question of establishing independent regimes in colonies under direct imperialist rule has changed as a result of the changes in the situation.
^fn8 These were the first counter-attacks which the people under Communist leadership launched in various places against the forcer of the counter-revolution after Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Ching-wei successively turned traitor to the revolution in 1927 On December 11, 1927, the workers and revolutionary soldiers of Canton united to stage an uprising, and set up the people's political power. 
They fought fiercely against the counter-revolutionary forces, which were directly supported by imperialism' but failed because the disparity in strength was too great. 
Peasants in Haifeng and Luteng on the eastern coast of Kwangtung Province had started a powerful revolutionary movement during 1923-25 under the leadership of Comrade Peng Pai, a member of the Communist Party, and this movement contributed greatly to the victory of the two eastern campaigns launched from Canton by the National Revolutionary Army against the counter-revolutionary clique headed by Chen Chiung-ming. 
After Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the revolution on April l2, 1927, these peasants staged three uprisings in April, September and October, and established a revolutionary regime which held out until April 1928. 
In eastern Hunan Province, insurrectionary peasants captured an area embracing Linyang, Pingkiang, Liling and Chuchow in September 1927. 
At about the same time, tens of thousands of peasants staged an armed uprising in Hsiaokan, Macheng and Huangan in northeastern Hupeh Province and occupied the county town of Huangan for over thirty days. 
In southern Hunan, peasants in the counties of Yichang, Chenchow, Leiyang, Yungheing and Tzehsing rose in arms in January 1928 and set up a revolutionary regime, which lasted for three months.
^fn9 The Red Guards were armed units of the masses in the revolutionary base areas, whose members carried on their regular productive work.
^fn10 The Lohsiao mountain range is a large range running along the borders of Kiangsi and Hunan Provinces. 
The Chingkang Mountains are in its middle section.
^fn11 By the term "petty bourgeoisie" Comrade Mao Tse-tung means those elements other than the peasants--handicraftsmen, small merchants, professional people of various kinds and petty-bourgeois intellectuals. 
In China they mostly live in cities but there are quite a number in the countryside.
^fn12 Five Wells designates the villages of Big Well, Small Well, Upper Well, Middle Well and Lower Well, in the Chingkang Mountains, which are situated between Yunghsin, Ningkang and Suichuan in western Kiangsi and Linghsien County in eastern Hunan.
^c4
^fn1 This war took place in October 1927.
^fn2 This war took place in November and December 1927.
^fn3 The system of the soldiers' representative conferences and soldiers' committees m the Red Army was later abolished. 
In 1947, the People's Liberation Army inaugurated a system of armymen's conferences and soldiers' committees, both under the leadership of cadres.
^fn4 These troops, originally under the command of Comrades Yeh Ting and Ho Lung, staged the Nanchang Uprising of August 1, 1927. 
They were defeated in their advance on Chaochow and Swatow, Kwangtung Province, and some units, led by Comrades Chu The, Lin Piao and Chen Yi, withdrew to southern Hunan via Kiangsi to carry on guerrilla operations. 
They joined Comrade Mao Tse-tung's forces in the Chingkang Mountains in April 1928.
^fn5 In the revolutionary days of 1927 most of the cadres in the Guards Regiment of the National Government at Wuchang were members of the Communist Party. 
At the end of July 1927, after Wang Ching-wei and his associates had betrayed the revolution, the regiment left Wuchang to join in the uprising at Nanchang. 
Learning en route that the revolutionary forces had already gone south from Nanchang, the regiment made a detour to Hsiushui in western Kiangsi to join the peasant armed forces of Pingkiang and Liuyang.
^fn6 In the spring of 1927 peasant armed forces of considerable strength were formed in the area of Pingkiang and Liuyang, Hunan Province. 
On May 21, Hsu Keh-hsiang staged a counter-revolutionary coup in Changsha and massacred the revolutionary masses. 
The peasant armed forces then marched on Changsha on May 31 to hit back at the counter-revolutionaries, but were stopped by the opportunist Chen Tu-hsiu and turned back. 
Thereupon a section was reorganized into an independent regiment to engage in guerrilla warfare. 
After the Nanchang Uprising on August 1, these armed peasants joined forces with the former Guards Regiment of the Wuchang National Government at Hsiushui and Tungku in Kiangsi Province and at Pingkiang and Liuyang in Hunan Province, and staged the Autumn Harvest Uprising in co-ordination with the armed coal miners of Pinghsiang, Kiangsi. 
In October Comrade Mao Tse-tung led these forces to the Chingkang Mountains.
^fn7 In early 1928, while Comrade Chu The was directing revolutionary guerrilla warfare in southern Hunan, peasant armies were organized in the counties of Yichang, Chenchow, Leiyang, Yunghsing and Tzehsing, where the peasant movement had already taken firm root. 
Comrade Chu The subsequently led them to the Chingkang Mountains to join the forces under Comrade Mao Tse-tung.
^fn8 Shuikoushan in Changning, Hunan Province, is well known for is lead mines. 
In 1922 the miners there led by the Communist Party formed a trade union and for years conducted struggles against the counter-revolution. 
Many of the miners joined the Red Army after the Autumn Harvest Uprising of 1927.
^fn9 The Anyuan Coal Mines in Pinghsiang County, Kiangsi Province, employing twelve thousand workers, were owned by the Han-Yeh-Ping Iron and Steel Company. 
From 1921 onwards Party organizations and a miners' union were set up there by the organizers sent by the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party.
^fn10 In 1929 the Party representatives in the Red Army were renamed political commissars. 
In 1931 the company political commissars were renamed political instructors.
^fn11 Expropriation of the local tyrants was only a temporary measure to defray part of the army's expenses. 
The expansion of the base areas and the growth of the army made it possible and necessary to defray army expenses through taxation.
^fn12 This practice of equal cash payment, necessary at the time, remained in force over many years in the Red Army. 
Later on, however, officers and men received payments which differed slightly according to rank.
^fn13 Here Comrade Mao Tse-tung lays special stress on the need for a definite measure of democracy in the revolutionary army, since, in the early period of the Red Army, without the stress on democracy it would not have been possible to arouse the revolutionary enthusiasm of the new peasant recruits and the captured White troops who had joined our ranks, nor would it have been possible to eliminate the warlord ways of the reactionary armies which had infected our cadres. 
Of course, democracy in the army must not transcend the limits of military discipline, which it must serve to strengthen and not weaken. 
Therefore, while a necessary measure of democracy should be promoted, the demand for ultra-democracy, which amounts to indiscipline, must be combated. 
Such indiscipline became a matter of serious concern at one point in the early days of the Red Army. 
For Comrade Mao Tse-tung's struggle against ultra-democracy in the army, see "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party", pp. 105-16 of this volume.
^fn14 Comrade Yeh Ting commanded an independent regiment during the Northern Expedition in 1926. 
With Communists as its nucleus the regiment became famous as a crack force. 
It was expanded into the 24th Division after the capture of Wuchang by the revolutionary army and then into the Eleventh Army after the Nanchang Uprising.
^fn15 Subsequent experience in the Red Army showed that a ratio of one Party member to two non-Party men was adequate. 
This proportion was generally maintained in the Red Army and later in the People's Liberation Army.
^fn16 Instigated by Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Ching-wei, the counter-revolutionary Kuomintang army commanders in Hunan, including Hsu Keh-hsiang and Ho Chien, ordered a raid on the provincial headquarters of the trade unions, the peasant associations and other revolutionary organizations in Changsha on May 21, 1927. 
Communists and revolutionary workers and peasants were arrested and killed en masse. 
This signalized the open collaboration of the two counter-revolutionary Kuomintang cliques, the Wuhan clique headed by Wang Ching-wei and the Nanking clique headed by Chiang Kai-shek.
^fn17 Confiscation and redistribution of all the land was a provision in the Land Law promulgated in the Hunan-Kiangsi border area in 1928. 
Comrade Mao Tse-tung later pointed out that the confiscation of all land, instead of only the land of the landlords, was a mistake stemming from inexperience in agrarian struggles. 
In the Land Law of Hsingkuo County, Kiangsi, adopted in April 1929, the provision "confiscate all the land" was changed into "confiscate the public land and the land of the landlord class".
^fn18 In view of the importance of winning over the intermediate class in the countryside, Comrade Mao Tse-tung soon corrected the erroneous policy of dealing too sharply with it. 
Apart from the present article, Comrade Mao Tse-tung's views on policy towards this class were also set forth in proposals to the Sixth Party Congress of the Red Army (November 1928), including "The Prohibition of Reckless Burning and Killing" and "Protection of the Interests of the Middle and Small Merchants"; in the January 1929 proclamation of the Fourth Red Army which declared "merchants in the towns who have gradually built up some property are to be left alone so long as they obey the authorities"; in the Land Law of Hsingkuo County adopted in April 1929 (see Note 17), etc.
^fn19 With the spread of the revolutionary war, the extension of the revolutionary base areas and the adoption of the policy of protecting industry and commerce by the revolutionary government, it became possible to change this situation, and a change did in fact occur later. 
What was crucial was resolutely to protect the industry and commerce of the national bourgeoisie and oppose ultra-Left policies.
^fn20 Labour-power is not an appropriate criterion for land distribution. 
In the Red areas land was in fact redistributed equally on a per capita basis.
^fn21 The Pacification Guards were a kind of local counter-revolutionary armed force.

^fn1 For a brief period after the defeat of the revolution in 1927, a "Left" putschist tendency arose in the Communist Party. 
Regarding the Chinese revolution as a "permanent revolution" and the revolutionary situation in China as a "permanent upsurge", the putschist comrades refused to organize an orderly retreat and, adopting the methods of commandism and relying only on a small number of Party members and a small section of the masses, erroneously attempted to stage a series of local uprisings throughout the country, which had no prospect of success. 
Such putschist activities were widespread at the end of 1927 but gradually subsided in the beginning of 1928, though sentiments in favour of putschism still survived among some comrades.
^fn2 In the guerrilla system of organization a column corresponded to a division in the regular army, with a complement much more flexible and usually much smaller than that of a regular division.
^fn3 These two Chinese idioms refer to the methods which some rebels in Chinese history adopted to expand their forces. 
In the application of these methods, attention was paid to numbers rather than to quality, and people of all sorts were indiscriminately recruited to swell the ranks.
^fn4 Huang Chao was the leader of the peasant revolts towards the end of the Tang Dynasty. 
In AD 875, starting from his home district Tsaochow (now Hotse County in Shantung), Huang led armed peasants in victorious battles against the imperial forces and styled himself the "Heaven-Storming General". 
In the course of a decade he swept over most of the provinces in the Yellow, Yangtse, Huai and Pearl river valleys, reaching as far as Kwangsi. 
He finally broke through the Tungkuan pass, captured the imperial capital of Changan (now Sian in Shensi), and was crowned Emperor of Chi. 
Internal dissensions and attacks by the non-Han tribal allies of the Tang forces compelled Huang to abandon Changan and retreat to his native district, where he committed suicide. 
The ten years' war fought by him is one of the most famous peasant wars in Chinese history. 
Dynastic historians record that "all people suffering from heavy taxes and levies rallied to him". 
But as he merely carried on roving warfare without ever establishing relatively consolidated base areas, his forces were called "roving rebel bands".
^fn5 Li Chuang, short for Li Tzu-cheng the King Chuang (the Dare-All King), native of Michih, northern Shensi, was the leader of a peasant revolt which led to the overthrow of the Ming Dynasty. 
The revolt first started in northern Shensi in 1628. 
Li joined the forces led by Kao Ying-hsiang and campaigned through Honan and Anhwei and back to Shensi. 
After Kao's death in 1636, Li succeeded him, becoming King Chuang, and campaigned in and out of the provinces of Shensi, Szechuan, Honan and Hupeh Finally he captured the imperial capital of Peking in 1644, whereupon the last Ming emperor committed suicide. 
The chief slogan he spread among the masses was "Support King Chuang, and pay no grain taxes". 
Another slogan of his to enforce discipline among his men ran: "Any murder means the killing of my father, any rape means the violation of my mother." Thus he won the support of the masses and his movement became the main current of the peasant revolts raging all over the country. 
As he, too, roamed about without ever establishing relatively consolidated base areas, he was eventually defeated by Wu San-kuei, a Ming general who colluded with the Ching troops in a joint aback on Li.

^fn1 Comrade Pang Chih-min, a native of Yiyang, Kiangsi Province, and a member of the Sixth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, was the founder of the Red area in northeastern Kiangsi and of the Tenth Red Army. 
In 1934 he led the vanguard detachment of the Red Army in marching north to resist the Japanese invaders. 
In January 1935 he was captured in battle against the counter-revolutionary Kuomintang troops and in July he died a martyr's death in Nanchang, Kiangsi.
^fn2 The subjective forces of the revolution mean the organized forces of the revolution.
^fn3 Lu Ti-ping, a Kuomintang warlord, was the Kuomintang governor of Hunan Province in 1928.
^fn4 The war of March-April 1929 between Chiang Kai-shek, the Kuomintang warlord in Nanking, and Li Tsung-jen and Pai Chung-hsi, the Kuomintang warlords in Kwangsi Province.
^fn5 The third invasion of the Red Army's base area on the Chingkang Mountains by the Kuomintang warlords in Hunan and Kiangsi lasting from the cad of 1928 to the beginning of 1929.
^fn6 The quotation is from Mencius, who compared a tyrant who drove his people into seeking a benevolent ruler to the otter which "drives the fish into deep waters".
^fn7 The Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held in July 1928. 
It pointed out that after the defeat in 1927, China's revolution remained bourgeois-democratic in nature, ie, anti-imperialist and anti-feudal, and that since the inevitable new high tide in the revolution was not yet imminent, the general line for the revolution should be to win over the masses. 
The Sixth Congress liquidated the 1927 Right capitulationism of Chen Tu-hsiu and also repudiated the "Left" putschism which occurred in the Party at the end of 1927 and the beginning of 1928.
^fn8 The statement in brackets has been added by the author.
^fn9 The regime set up in western Fukien came into bang in 1929, when the Red Army in the Chingkang Mountains sallied eastward to build a new revolutionary base area and established the people's revolutionary political power in the counties of Lungyen, Yungting and Shanghang in the western part of that province.
^fn10 Stable base areas were the relatively stable revolutionary base areas established by the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army.
^fn11 Chiang Po-cheng was then the commander of the Kuomintang peace preservation corps in Chekiang Province.
^fn12 Chen Kuo-hui and Lu Hsing-pang were two notorious Fukien bandits whose forces had been incorporated into the Kuomintang army.
^fn13 Chang Chen was a divisional commander of the Kuomintang army.
^fn14 Chu Pei-the, a Kuomintang warlord, was then the Kuomintang governor of Kiangsi Province.
^fn15 Hsiung Shih-hui was then a divisional commander of the Kuomintang army in Kiangsi Province.

^fn1 Between 1930 and 1934 Chiang Kai-shek launched five large-scale onslaughts against the Red area centred on Juichin, Kiangsi; they were called "encirclement and suppression" campaigns. 
The fifth of such campaigns began in October 1 though Chiang Kai-shek had been making active preparations for it since the summer.
^fn2 A campaign to check up land distribution was carried out in the Red area after the agrarian reform to ascertain whether the land had been properly redistributed.
^fn3 Exposure campaigns were democratic campaigns in which the people were encouraged to expose misdeeds by the functionaries of the democratic government.
^c9
^fn1 There were various forms of public land in China's rural areas--
land owned by the township or district government,
 by the ancestral temple of a clan, by a Buddhist or Taoist temple, a Catholic church or a mosque,
 or land whose income was used for public welfare purposes such as famine relief,
 or the building and maintenance of bridges and roads, or for educational purposes.
 In practice, most of such land was controlled by the landlords and rich peasants, and few peasants had any say in its administration.
^c10
^fn1 There was usually a decline in farm output in the first year or two after the establishment of a Red area, chiefly because landownership was not yet settled and the new economic order was not fully established during land redistribution, so that the peasants could not yet set their minds fully on production.
^fn2 Mutual-aid groups and ploughing teams, based on individual farming, were formed by peasants in the Red areas to facilitate production through a better organization of labour power. 
On the principle of voluntary participation and mutual benefit, the members did an equal amount of work for each other, or if one could not give another as much help as he received he made up the difference in cash. 
Apart from helping each other, the teams gave preferential treatment to the families of Red Army soldiers and worked for bereaved old folk without any pay except for meals during the work. 
As these measures of mutual aid were of great help to production and were carried out on a reasonable basis they won the warm support of the masses.
^c11
^fn1 Changkang Township is in Hsingkuo County, Kiangsi Province.
^fn2 Tsaihsi Township is in Shanghang County, Pukien Province.
^fn3 Kunglueh County was then in the Red area in Kiangsi, with the town of Tungku lying southeast of Kian County as its centre. 
It was named after Comrade Huang Kung-lueh, Commander of the Third Army Corps of the Red Army, who laid down his life there in October 1931.
^fn4 The building of blockhouses round the Red areas was decided upon by Chiang Kai-shek at his military conference held at Lushan, Kiangsi Province in July 1933, as a new military tactic for his fifth "encirclement and suppression" campaign. 
By the end of January 1934 an estimated total of 2,900 blockhouses had been built in Kiangsi Province. 
The Japanese aggressors later adopted the same tactic against the Eighth Route and the New Fourth Armies. 
Experience fully proved that the counter-revolutionary tactic of using blockhouses could be completely foiled and defeated by adhering to Comrade Mao Tse-tung's strategy of people's war.
^c12
^fn1 The Twenty-one Demands on the Yuan Shih-kai government were presented by the Japanese imperialists on January 18. 1915. 
On May 7, they sent an ultimatum demanding a reply within forty-eight hours. 
The demands were divided into five parts. 
The first four contained the following: to transfer to Japan the rights Germany had seized in Shantung and to grant Japan additional rights in the province; to grant rights to the Japanese to lease or own land in southern Manchuria and eastern Mongolia and to establish residence, engage in industry and commerce, and have exclusive railway building and mining rights there; to reorganize the Han-Yeh-Ping Iron and Steel Company as a joint Sino-Japanese enterprise; and to undertake not to lease or cede any harbours or islands along China's coastline to any third power. 
The fifth part contained demands that Japan should control China's political, financial, military and police affairs and should build vital railway lines connecting the provinces of Hupeh, Kiangsi and Kwangtung. 
Yuan Shih-kai accepted all the demands except those in the fifth part, about which he pleaded for "further negotiations". 
Thanks to the unanimous opposition of the Chinese people, Japan failed to get her demands implemented.
^fn2 Yuan Shih-kai was the head of the Northern warlords in the last years of the Ching Dynasty. 
After the Ching Dynasty was overthrown by the Revolution of 1911, he usurped the presidency of the Republic and organized the first government of the Northern warlords, which represented the big landlord and big comprador classes. 
He did this by relying on counter-revolutionary armed force and on the support of the imperialists and by taking advantage of the conciliationist nature of the bourgeoisie then leading the revolution. 
In 1915 he wanted to make himself emperor and, to gain the support of the Japanese imperialists, accepted the Twenty-one Demands with which Japan aimed at obtaining exclusive control of all China. 
In December of the same year an uprising against his assumption of the throne took place in Yunnan Province and promptly won country-wide response and support. 
Yuan Shih-kai died in Peking in June 1916.
^fn3 The Nine-Power Conference in Washington was called by the USA government in November 1921; China, Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal and Japan were invited. 
It was a struggle between the United States and Japan for hegemony in the Far East. 
On February 6, 1922, a nine-power treaty was concluded on the basis of the principle, advanced by the United States, of the "open door" or "equal opportunities for all nations in China". 
The aim of this treaty was to create a situation in which the imperialist powers had joint control of China, and it actually cleared the way for exclusive domination by the USA imperialists, the purpose being to frustrate Japan's plans for exclusive domination.
^fn4 On September 18, 1931, the Japanese "Kwantung Army" in northeastern China seized Shenyang. 
Under Chiang Kai-shek's order of "absolute non-resistance", the Chinese troops at Shenyang and elsewhere in the Northeast (the Northeastern Army) withdrew to the south of Shanhaikuan, and consequently the Japanese forces rapidly occupied the provinces of Liaoning, Kirin and Heilungkiang. 
This act of Japanese aggression has become known as the "September 18th Incident".
^fn5 The "four northeastern provinces" were then Liaoning, Kirin, Heilungkiang and Jehol, which correspond to the present Liaoning, Kirin and Heilungkiang Provinces, the northeastern part of Hopei Province north of the Great Wall and the eastern part of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region. 
After the September 18th Incident, the Japanese invaders occupied Liaoning, Kirin and Heilungkiang and later, in 1933, seized Jehol.
^fn6 At the instigation of the Japanese, a puppet regime called the "Eastern Hopei Anti-Communist Autonomous Administration" was established in twenty-two counties in eastern Hopei by the Kuomintang traitor Yin Ju-keng on November 25, 1935. 
This became known as the Eastern Hopei Incident.
^fn7 The diplomatic talks between the Chiang Kai-shek government and the Japanese government discussed the so called "Three Principles of Hirota", ie, the "Three Principles for Dealing with China" put forward by Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota, namely, (1) suppression by China of all anti-Japanese movements; (2) establishment of economic co-operation between China, Japan and "Manchukuo"; and (3) joint defence by China and Japan against communism. 
On January 21, 1936, Hirota told the Diet that the Chinese government "has accepted the three principles proposed by the Empire".
^fn8 The year 1935 witnessed a new upsurge in the popular patriotic movement throughout the country. 
Students in Peking, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, held a patriotic demonstration on December 9, putting forward such slogans as "Stop the civil war and unite to resist foreign aggression" and "Down with Japanese imperialism". 
This movement broke through the long reign of terror imposed by the Kuomintang government in league with the Japanese invaders and very quickly won the people's support throughout the country. 
It is known as the "December 8th Movement". 
The outcome was that new changes manifested themselves in the relations among the various classes in the country, and the Anti-Japanese National United Front proposed by the Communist Party of China became the openly advocated policy of all patriotic people. 
The Chiang Kai-shek government with its traitorous policy became very isolated.
^fn9 At the time of this report Chiang Kai-shek, after selling out the Northeast to Japan, was selling out northern China while actively keeping up his fighting against the Red Army. 
Therefore the Chinese Communist Party had to do its best to expose him as a traitor, and naturally he was not included in the Anti-Japanese National United Front proposed by the Party. 
But already in this report Comrade Mao Tse-tung mentioned the possible disintegration of the camp of the Chinese landlord and comprador classes as a result of the contradictions among the imperialist powers. 
And Japan's attack on northern China did subsequently lead to serious dashes of interest between Japanese and Anglo-American imperialism. 
The Chinese Communist Party maintained that the Chiang Kai-shek clique, with its close ties with Anglo- American imperialist interests, might change its attitude to Japan at its masters' bidding, and therefore it adopted the policy of compelling Chiang Kai-shek to resist Japan. 
On its return to northern Shensi from Shansi, in May 1936 the Red Army appealed directly to the Nanking Kuomintang government for an end to the civil war and for united resistance to Japan. 
In August of the same year, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party addressed a letter to the Kuomintang's Central Executive Committee, calling for the formation of a bi-partisan united front against Japan and negotiations between the representatives of both parties. 
But Chiang Kai-shek rejected these proposals. 
It was not until December 1936 when Chiang Kai-shek was detained in Sian by Kuomintang army officers who favoured alliance with the Communists against Japan that he was compelled to accept the Communist Party's demand for ending the civil war and resisting Japan.
^fn10 Tsai Ting-kai was deputy commander of the Kuomintang's 19th Route Army and commander of one of its corps, the two other leaders being Chen Ming-shu and Chiang Kuang-nai. 
This army, which had fought the Red Army in Kiangsi, was transferred to Shanghai after the September 18th Incident. 
The mounting anti-Japanese tide of the people in Shanghai and the whole country had a great impact on the 19th Route Army. 
When the Japanese marines attacked in Shanghai during the night of January 28, 1932, the Army and the people of Shanghai put up a joint resistance. 
However, the battle was lost through the treachery of Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Ching-wei. 
Later, on Chiang's orders, the 19th Route Army was transferred to Fukien to fight the Red Army again. 
But the leaders of the Army gradually came to realize the futility of such fighting. 
In November 1933, allying themselves with Kuomintang forces under Li Chi-shen and others, they publicly renounced Chiang Kai-shek, established the "People's Revolutionary Government of the Republic of China" in Fukien, and concluded an agreement with the Red Army to resist Japan and oppose Chiang Kai-shek. 
The 19th Route Army and Fukien People's Government collapsed under the attacks of Chiang's troops. 
From then on, Tsai Ting-kai and others gradually moved towards a position of co-operation with the Communist Party.
^fn11 Peng Yu-hsiang, together with the forces under his command in Suiyuan Province, announced his break with the Northern warlord clique and joined the revolution when the revolutionary Northern Expeditionary Army reached Wuhan in September 1926. 
Early in 1927, his troops moved in from Shensi to attack Honan Province in co-ordination with the Northern Expeditionary Army. 
Although Feng participated in anti-Communist activities following the betrayal of the revolution by Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Ching-wei in 1927, there was always a clash of interests between him and the Chiang Kai-shek clique. 
After Japan invaded China on September 18, 1931 he favoured resistance and in May 1933 co-operated with the Communist Party in forming the people's Anti-Japanese Allied Army in Changchiakou. 
His efforts came to naught in August under the pressure of both Chiang Kai-shek's forces and the Japanese invaders. 
In his later years Feng continued to co-operate with the Communist Party.
^fn12 An uprising took place at Ningtu, Kiangsi in December 1931 within the Kuomintang's 26th Route Army, which was sent by Chiang Kai-shek to attack the Red Army in Kiangsi Province. 
Led by Comrades Chao Po-sheng and Tung Chen-tang, more than ten thousand officers and men rose up and joined the Red Army in response to the Communist call for resistance to Japan.
^fn13 Ma Chan-shan was an officer of the Kuomintang's Northeastern Army whose troops were stationed in Heilungkiang. 
He and his men fought the Japanese invaders who drove towards Heilungkiang via Liaoning after the September 18th Incident.
^fn14 Hu Han-min, a well-known Kuomintang politician, was an opponent of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's policy of co-operation with the Chinese Communist Party and was Chiang Kai-shek's accomplice in the counter-revolutionary coup d'état of April 12, 1927. 
Later he fell out with Chiang in a struggle for power and was held in detention by the latter. 
Set free after the September 18th Incident, he left Nanking for Canton where he instigated the warlords of Kwangtung and Kwangsi to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's Nanking government for a considerable period of time.
^fn15 The Six-Point Programme for Resisting Japan and Saving the Nation was the "Chinese People's Basic Programme for Fighting Japan" put forward by the Chinese Communist Party in 1934 and published over the signatures of Soong Ching Ling (Mme. 
Sun Yat-sen) and others. 
The programme consisted of the following points: (1) mobilize all sea, land and air forces to fight Japan; (2) mobilize the people throughout the country; (3) arm all the people; (4) confiscate the property of the Japanese imperialists in China and of the traitors to defray war expenditure; (5) establish an all-China committee for national armed defence, to be elected by the representatives of workers, peasants, soldiers, students and businessmen; and (6) form an alliance with all the forces opposed to the Japanese imperialists, and establish friendly relations with all countries observing benevolent neutrality.
^fn16 These warlords were Chen Chi-tang of Kwangtung and Li Tsung-jen and Pai Chung-hsi of Kwangsi.
^fn17 The Chiang Kai-shek gang of bandits described the revolutionary people as "bandits" and their armed attacks upon and massacre of the revolutionary people as "bandit suppression".
^fn18 Comrade Jen Pi-shih was a veteran member of the Chinese Communist Party and one of its first organizers. 
He was a member of the Party's Central Committee from its Fifth National Congress in 1927 onwards. 
He was elected to the Political Bureau at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee in 1931. 
In 1933 he served as secretary of the Provincial Party Committee of the Hunan-Kiangsi Border Area and concurrently as political commissar of the Sixth Army Group of the Red Army. 
When the Sixth and Second Army Groups joined forces and formed the Second Front Army, he was appointed its political commissar. 
He was Director of the General Political Department of the Eighth Route Army in the first years of the War of Resistance. 
In 1940 he began to serve in the Secretariat of the Party's Central Committee. 
At the First Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee in 1945 he was again elected a member of the Political Bureau and of the Secretariat. 
Comrade Jen Pi-shih died in Peking on October 27, 1950.
^fn19 The Sixth Army Group of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, originally stationed in the Hunan-Kiangsi border area, broke through the enemy's siege and shifted its position in August 1934 on the orders of the Party's Central Committee. 
In October it joined forces with the Second Army Group led by Comrade Ho Lung in eastern Kweichow, and together they formed the Second Front Army of the Red Army and created the Hunan-Hupeh-Szechuan-Kweichow revolutionary base area.
^fn20 In October 1934 the First Third and Fifth Army Groups of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army (that is, the First Front Army of the Red Army, also known as the Central Red Army) set out from Changting and Ninghua in western Fukien and from Juichin, Yutu and other places in southern Kiangsi and started a major strategic movement. 
In traversing the eleven provinces of Fukien, Kiangsi, Kwangtung, Hunan, Kwangsi, Kweichow, Szechuan, Yunnan, Sikang, Kansu and Shensi, crossing perpetually snow-capped mountains and trackless grasslands, sustaining untold hardships and frustrating the enemy's repeated encirclements, pursuits, obstructions and interceptions, the Red Army covered 25,000 li (12,500 kilometres) on this march and finally arrived triumphantly at the revolutionary base area in northern Shensi in October 1935.
^fn21 The Red Army in the Szechuan-Shensi border area was the Fourth Front Army of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. 
In March 1935, it shifted from its base in the Szechuan-Shensi border area to the borders of Szechuan and Sikang Provinces. 
In June, it joined forces with the First Front Army in Maokung in western Szechuan and advanced northward by two routes, a right route and a left route. 
But on arriving in the Maoerhkai area near Sungpan in September, Chang Kuo-tao of the Fourth Front Army led the troops on the left route in a southward direction, in defiance of the Central Committee's orders, thus causing a disruption in the Red Army. 
The Second Front Army, which had broken through the enemy's siege and left the Hunan-Hupeh-Szechuan-Kweichow border area, arrived at Kantze, Sikang Province, in June 1936 via Hunan, Kweichow and Yunnan, and there it joined forces with the Fourth Front Army. 
Acting against Chang Kuo-tao's wishes, the comrades in the Fourth Front Army resumed the shift northward together with the Second Front Army. 
In October, the entire Second Front Army and a part of the Fourth Front Army arrived in northern Shensi and succeeded in joining forces with the First Front Army.
^fn22 Chang Kuo-tao was a renegade from the Chinese revolution. 
Speculating on the revolution, he joined the Chinese Communist Party in his youth. 
In the Party he made many mistakes and ended by committing grave crimes. 
Most notoriously, in 1935 he opposed the Red Army's northward march, advocating a defeatist and liquidationist withdrawal by the Red Army to the minority-nationality areas on the Szechuan-Sikang border, and he engaged in openly traitorous activities against the Party and the Central Committee, established his own bogus central committee, disrupted the unity of the Party and the Red Army, and caused heavy losses to its Fourth Front Army. 
Thanks to patient education by Comrade Mao Tse-tung and the Central Committee, the Fourth Front Army and its numerous cadres soon came back under the correct leadership of the Central Committee and played an honourable part in subsequent struggles. 
Chang Kuo-tao, however, proved incorrigible, escaped by himself from the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region in the spring of 1938 and joined the Kuomintang secret police.
^fn23 The Central Red Army, or the First Front Army, refers to the Red Army that was built up in the Kiangsi-Fukien area directly under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
^fn24 Pan Ku, according to Chinese mythology, was the creator of the world and the first ruler of mankind. 
The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors were legendary rulers in ancient China.
^fn25 In July 1935, the Kuomintang troops started their third "encirclement and suppression" campaign against the Shensi-Kansu revolutionary base area. 
The 26th Army Corps of the Northern Shensi Red Army routed two enemy brigades in the eastern sector and drove the enemy to the east of the Yellow River. 
In September, the 25th Army Corps of the Red Army, which had been operating in the Hupeh-Honan-Anhwei base area, joined forces with the Northern Shensi Red Army after arriving in northern Shensi via southern Shensi and eastern Kansu, and together they formed the 15th Army Group of the Red Army. 
In the Kanchuan-Laoshan campaign, this army group wiped out most of the enemy 110th Division, killed its divisional commander and in a subsequent action destroyed four battalions of the enemy's 107th Division at Yulinchiao, Kanchuan County. 
The enemy organized new attacks and put Tung Ying-pin (an army corps commander of the Northeastern Army) in command of five divisions, which mounted an attack along two routes; the division on the east route drove northward by way of Lochuan and Fuhsien and the other four divisions on the west route drove along the Hulu River towards Fuhsien northern Shensi, via Chingyang and Hoshui in Kansu. 
By October, the Central Red Army reached northern Shensi. 
In the following month the Central Red Army and the 15th Army Group jointly wiped out the enemy's 109th Division in Chihlochen, southwest of Fuhsien, and eliminated one regiment of the enemy's 106th Division at Heishuisze in the course of pursuit. 
Thus the enemy's third "encirclement and suppression" campaign against the Shensi-Kansu border area was completely smashed.
^fn26 When the main forces of the Red Army in southern China shifted position during 1934-35, they left behind some units to operate as guerrillas. 
These guerrilla units held out in the following fourteen base areas in eight provinces: southern Chekiang, northern Fukien, eastern Fukien, southern Fukien, western Fukien, northeastern Kiangsi, the Fukien-Kiangsi border, the Kwangtung-Kiangsi border, southern Hunan, the Hunan-Kiangsi border, the Hunan-Hupeh-Kiangsi border, the Hupeh-Honan-Anhwei border, the Tungpai Mountains in southern Honan and Hainan Island off the coast of Kwangtung.
^fn27 After the Japanese imperialists occupied the Northeast in 1931, the Chinese Communist Party called upon the people to put up armed resistance. 
It organized anti-Japanese guerrilla units, formed the Northeastern People's Revolutionary Army and rendered assistance to various volunteer forces fighting the enemy. 
In 1934, under the leadership of the Party, all these forces were reorganized into the single Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, with the outstanding Communist Yang Ching-yu as Commander-in-Chief. 
This army kept up anti-Japanese guerrilla war in the Northeast for a long time. 
The anti-Japanese guerrilla war in eastern Hopei refers to the peasant uprising against Japan there in May 1935.
^fn28 The revolutionary war led by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union refers to the fighting from 1918 to 1920 in which the Soviet people beat off armed intervention by Britain, the United States, France, Japan, Poland, etc., and suppressed the White Guard rebellion.
^fn29 The political power and the policies of a people's republic, as here enunciated by Comrade Mao Tse-tung, were made a reality in the people's Liberated Areas under the leadership of the Communist Party during the War of Resistance. 
That was why the Party was able to lead the people behind the enemy lines in waging a victorious war against the Japanese invaders. 
After Japan's surrender, the Third Revolutionary Civil War broke out. 
As the war went on, the area liberated by the people gradually extended to the whole of China, and in this way the unified People's Republic of China was born. 
Thus Comrade Mao Tse-tung's ideal of a people's republic was eventually realized throughout the country.
^fn30 The Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of China held in July 1928 adopted the following Ten-Point Programme: (1) overthrow imperialist rule; (2) confiscate foreign capitalist enterprises and banks; (3) unify China and recognize the right of the nationalities to self-determination; (4) overthrow the Kuomintang warlord government; (5) establish a government of councils of workers, peasants and soldiers; (6) institute the eight-hour day, increase wages, and establish unemployment relief and social insurance, (7) confiscate the land of all landlords and distribute the land among the peasants. 
(8) improve the living conditions of the soldiers, give land and jobs to ex-soldiers; (9) abolish all exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies and adopt a consolidated progressive tax; and (10) unite with the world proletariat, unite with the Soviet Union.
^fn31 Originally an anti-Leninist faction in the Russian working-class movement, the Trotskyite group later degenerated into a downright counter-revolutionary gang. 
In his report to the plenary session of the Central Committee of the CPSU (B) in 1937, Comrade Stalin explained the course this group of renegades had run as follows:
In the past, seven or eight years ago, Trotskyism was one of such political trends in the working class, an anti-Leninist trend, it is true, and therefore profoundly mistaken, but nevertheless a political trend…. 
Present-day Trotskyism is not a political trend in the working class, but a gang without principle and without ideas, of wreckers and diversionists, intelligence service agents, spies, murderers, a gang of sworn enemies of the working class, working in the pay of the intelligence services of foreign states.
After the failure of the Chinese revolution in 1927, a small number of Trotskyites appeared in China, too. 
Ganging up with Chen Tu-hsiu and other renegades, they formed a small counter-revolutionary clique in 1929 and spread such counterrevolutionary propaganda as that the Kuomintang had already completed the bourgeois-democratic revolution, and they became a dirty imperialist and Kuomintang instrument against the people. 
The Chinese Trotskyites shamelessly joined the Kuomintang secret service. 
After the September 18th Incident, to fulfil the order given by the criminal renegade Trotsky "not to impede the occupation of China by imperial Japan", they began collaborating with Japanese secret agents, received subsidies from them and engaged in all kinds of activities facilitating Japanese aggression.
^fn32 This quotation is from Mencius. 
Mencius made this remark because in the period known as the Spring and Autumn Era (722-481 BC) the feudal princes of China incessantly fought one another for power.
^fn33 Faced with the opposition of the Chinese people to her traffic in opium, Britain sent forces in 1840-42 to invade Kwangtung and other coastal regions of China, under the pretext of protecting trade. 
Led by Lin Tse-hsu, the troops in Kwangtung fought a war of resistance. 
A "Quell-the-British Corps" which was spontaneously organized by the people of Canton also dealt the British aggressors severe blows.
^fn34 The War of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was a peasant revolutionary war in the middle of the 19th century against the feudal rule and national oppression of the Ching Dynasty. 
In January 1851 Hung Hsiu-chuan, Yang Hsiu-ching and other leaders of this revolution staged an uprising in Chintien Village of Kueiping County in Kwangsi and proclaimed the founding of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. 
In 1852 the peasant army, proceeding northward from Kwangsi, marched through Hunan, Hupeh, Kiangsi and Anhwei and in 1853 captured Nanking, the main city on the lower Yangtse. 
A part of the forces then continued the drive north and pushed to the vicinity of Tientsin. 
However, the Taiping army failed to build stable base areas in the places it occupied, and also, after establishing its capital in Nanking, the leading group in the army committed many political and military errors; therefore it could not withstand the combined onslaught of the counter-revolutionary forces of the Ching government and of the British, USA and French aggressors, and it was finally defeated in 1864.
^fn35 The Yi Ho Tuan War was the vast spontaneous movement of the peasants and handicraftsmen in northern China in 1900. 
Forming themselves into mystical secret societies, these peasants and handicraftsmen carried on armed struggle against the imperialists. 
But the movement was put down with indescribable savagery, and Peking and Tientsin were occupied by the joint forces of eight imperialist powers.

^fn1 The science of strategy, the science of campaigns and the science of tactics are all components of Chinese military science. 
The science of strategy deals with the laws that govern the war situation as a whole. 
The science of campaigns deals with the laws that govern campaigns and is applied in directing campaigns. 
The science of tactics deals with the laws that govern battles and is applied in directing battles.
^fn2 Sun Wu Tzu, or Sun Wu, was a famous Chinese military scientist in the 5th century BC, who wrote Sun Tzu, a treatise on war containing thirteen chapters. 
This quotation is from Chapter 3, "The Strategy of Attack".
^fn3 When Comrade Mao Tse-tung wrote this article in 1936, it was exactly fifteen years since the founding of the Chinese Communist Party in July 1921.
^fn4 Chen Tu-hsiu was originally a professor at Peking University and became famous as an editor of New Youth. 
He was one of the founders of the Communist Party of China. 
Owing to his reputation at the time of the May 4th Movement and owing to the Party's immaturity in its initial period, he became General Secretary of the Party. 
In the last period of the revolution of 1924-27, the Rightist thinking in the Party represented by Chen Tu-hsiu developed into a line of capitulationism. 
Comrade Mao Tse-tung has observed that the capitulationists at that time "voluntarily gave up the Party's leadership of the peasant masses, urban petty bourgeoisie and middle bourgeoisie, and in particular gave up the Party's leadership of the armed forces, thus causing the defeat of the revolution" ("The Present Situation and Our Tasks", , Eng. ed., FLP, Peking, 1961, Vol. IV, p. 171). 
After the defeat of 1927 Chen Tu-hsiu and a handful of other capitulationists lost faith in the future of the revolution and became liquidationists. 
They took the reactionary Trotskyist stand and together with the Trotskyites formed a small anti-Party group. 
Consequently Chen Tu-hsiu was expelled from the Party in November 1929. 
He died in 1942.
^fn5 The "Left" opportunism of Li Li-san, generally known as the "Li Li-san line", refers to the "Left" opportunist line which existed in the Party for about four months beginning from June 1930 and which was represented by Comrade Li Li-san, then the most influential leader of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. 
The Li Li-san line had the following characteristics: It violated the policy of the Party's Sixth National Congress; it denied that mass strength had to be built up for the revolution and denied that the development of the revolution was uneven; it regarded as "extremely erroneous… localism and conservatism characteristic of peasant mentality" the ideas of Comrade Mao Tse-tung that for a long time we should devote our attention mainly to creating rural base areas, use the rural areas to encircle the cities and use these bases to advance a high tide of country-wide revolution; and it held that preparations should be made for immediate insurrections in all parts of the country. 
On the basis of this erroneous line, Comrade Li Li-san drew up an adventurist plan for organizing immediate armed insurrections in the key cities throughout the country. 
At the same time, he refused to recognize the uneven development of the world revolution, holding that the general outbreak of the Chinese revolution would inevitably lead to a general outbreak of world revolution, without which the Chinese revolution could not be successful; he also refused to recognize the protracted nature of China's bourgeois-democratic revolution, holding that the beginnings of victory in one or more provinces would mark the beginning of the transition to socialist revolution, and thus formulated a number of inappropriate "Left" adventurist policies. 
Comrade Mao Tse-tung opposed this erroneous line, and the broad masses of cadres and members in the Party also demanded its rectification. 
At the Third Plenary Session of the Party's Sixth Central Committee in September 1930 Comrade Li Li-san admitted the mistakes that had been pointed out and then relinquished his leading position in the Central Committee. 
Over a long period of time Comrade Li Li-san corrected his wrong views, and so he was re-elected to the Central Committee at the Seventh National Congress of the Party.
^fn6 The Third Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party held in September 1930, and the subsequent central leading body adopted many positive measures to put an end to the Li Li-san line. 
But later a number of Party comrades who were inexperienced in practical revolutionary struggle, with Chen Shao-yu (Wang Ming) and Chin Pang-hsien (Po Ku) in the lead, came out against the Central Committee's measures. 
In the pamphlet, The Two Lines or The Struggle for the Further Bolshevization of the Communist Party of China, they most emphatically declared that the main danger then existing in the Party was not "Left" opportunism but "Right opportunism" and, to justify their own activities, they "criticized" the Li Li-san line as "Rightist". 
They put forward a new political programme which continued, revived or developed the Li Li-san line and other "Left" ideas and policies in a new guise, and set themselves against the correct line of Comrade Mao Tse-tung. 
It was mainly to criticize the military mistakes of this new "Left" opportunist line that Comrade Mao Tse-tung wrote the present article "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War". 
This line was dominant in the Party from the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee in January 1931 to the meeting of the Political Bureau convened by the Central Committee at Tsunyi, Kweichow Province, in January 1935, which ended the dominance of this erroneous line and established the new central leadership headed by Comrade Mao Tse-tung. 
The erroneous "Left" line dominated the Party for a particularly long time (four years) and brought extremely heavy losses, with disastrous consequences, to the Party and the revolution. 
A loss of go per cent was inflicted on the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese Red Army and its base areas tens of millions of people in the revolutionary base areas were made to suffer the cruel oppression of the Kuomintang, and the progress of the Chinese revolution was retarded. 
The overwhelming majority of the errant comrades have realized and corrected their mistakes through a long process of learning from experience and have done much good work for the Party and the people. 
Under Comrade Mao Tse-tung's leadership they are now united with the masses of other comrades in the Party on the basis of a common political understanding.

^fn8 The Officers' Training Corps at Lushan was an organization set up by Chiang Kai-shek in July 1933 on Lushan Mountain in Kiukiang, Kiangsi Province, for training anti-Communist military cadres. 
Officers of Chiang Kai-shek's armed forces were sent there in rotation to receive fascist military and political training from German, Italian and American instructors.
^fn9 These new military principles largely constituted the Chiang Kai-shek gang's policy of "blockhouse warfare" in accordance with which it advanced gradually and entrenched itself at every step.

^fn17 The peace treaty of Brest-Litovsk was concluded between Soviet Russia and Germany in March 1918. 
Confronted with obviously superior enemy forces, the revolutionary forces had to make a temporary retreat in order to prevent the German imperialists from launching an attack on the new-born Soviet Republic, which as yet had no army of its own. 
The conclusion of this treaty gained time for the Soviet Republic to consolidate the political power of the proletariat, reorganize its economy and build up the Red Army. 
It enabled the proletariat to maintain its leadership over the peasantry and build up sufficient strength to defeat the White Guards and the armed intervention of Britain, the United States, France, Japan, Poland and other countries in 1918-20.
^fn18 On October 30, 1927 the peasants of the Haifeng-Lufeng area of Kwangtung Province launched their third insurrection under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. 
They occupied Haifeng and Lufeng and the surrounding area, organized a Red Army and established the democratic political power of the workers and peasants. 
They were later defeated because they made the mistake of underestimating the enemy.
^fn19 The Fourth Front Army and the Second Front Army of the Red Army joined forces in the autumn of 1936 and shifted northward from the northeastern part of Sikang. 
Chang Kuo-tao was then still persisting in his anti-Party stand and in his policy of retreat and liquidation. 
In October of the same year, when the Second and Fourth Front Armies arrived in Kansu, he ordered the advance units of the Fourth Front Army, numbering more than 20,000, to organize the Western Column for crossing the Yellow River and advancing westward to Chinghai. 
This Column was practically defeated after suffering blows in battles in December 1936 and was completely defeated in March 1937.

^fn21 Shui Hu Chuan (Heroes of the Marshes) is a celebrated Chinese novel describing a peasant war. 
The novel is attributed to Shih Nai-an who lived around the end of the Yuan Dynasty and the beginning of the Ming Dynasty (14th century). 
Lin Chung and Chai Chin are both heroes in this novel. 
Hung is the drill master on Chai Chin's estate.
^fn22 Lu and Chi were two feudal states in the Spring and Autumn Era (722-481 BC). 
Chi was a big state in the central part of the present Shantung Province, nod Lu was a smaller one in the southern part. 
Duke Chuang reigned over Lu from 693 to 662 BC.
^fn23 Tsochiu Ming was the author of Tso Chuan, a classical chronicle of the Chou Dynasty. 
For the passage quoted, see the section in Tso Chuan enticed "The loth Year of Duke Chuang" (684 BC).
^fn24 The ancient town of Chengkao, in the northwest of the present Chengkao County, Honan Province, was of great military importance. 
It was the scene of battles fought in 203 BC between Liu Pang, King of Han, and Hsiang Yu, King of Chu. 
At first Hsiang Yu captured Hsingyang and Chengkao and Liu Pang's troops were almost routed. 
Liu Pang waited until the opportune moment when Hsiang Yu's troops were in midstream crossing the Szeshui River, and then crushed them and recaptured Chengkao.
^fn25 The ancient town of Kunyang, in the north of the present Yehhsien County, Honan Province, was the place where Liu Hsiu, founder of the Eastern Han Dynasty, defeated the troops of Wang Mang, Emperor of the Hsin Dynasty, in AD 23. 
There was a huge numerical disparity between the two sides, Liu Hsiu's forces totalling 8,000 to 9,000 men as against Wang Mang's 400,000. 
But taking advantage of the negligence of Wang Mang's generals, Wang Hsun and Wang Yi, who underestimated the enemy, Liu Hsiu with only 3,000 picked troops put Wang Mang's main forces to rout. 
He followed up this victory by crushing the rest of the enemy troops.
^fn26 Kuantu was in the northeast of the present Chungmou County, Honan Province, and the scene of the battle between the armies of Tsao Tsao and Yuan Shao in AD 200. 
Yuan Shao had an army of 100,000 while Tsao Tsao had only a meagre force and was short of supplies. 
Taking advantage of lack of vigilance on the part of Yuan Shao's troops, who belittled the enemy, Tsao Tsao dispatched his light-footed soldiers to spring a surprise attack on them and set their supplies on fire. 
Yuan Shao's army was thrown into confusion and its main force wiped out.
^fn27 The state of Wu was ruled by Sun Chuan, and the state of Wei by Tsao Tsao. 
Chihpi is situated on the south bank of the Yangtse River, to the northeast of Chinyni Hupeh Province. 
In AD 208 Tsao Tsao led an army of over 500,000 men, which he proclaimed to be 800,000 strong, to launch an attack on Sun Chuan. 
The latter, in alliance with Tsao Tsao's antagonist Liu Pei, mustered a force of 30,000. 
Knowing that Tsao Tsao's army was plagued by epidemics and was unaccustomed to action afloat, the allied forces of Sun Chuan and Liu Pei set fire to Tsao Tsao's fleet and crushed his army.
^fn28 Yiling, to the east of the present Ichang, Hupeh Province, was the place where Lu Hsun, a general of the state of Wu, defeated the army of Liu Pei, ruler of Shu, in AD 222. 
Liu Pei's troops scored successive victories at the beginning of the war and penetrated five or six hundred li into the territory of Wu as far as Yiling. 
Lu Hsun, who was defending Yiling, avoided battle for over seven months until Liu Pei "was at his wits' end and his troops were exhausted and demoralized". 
Then he crushed Liu Pei's troops by taking advantage of a favourable wind to set fire to their tents.
^fn29 Hsieh Hsuan, a general of Eastern Tsin Dynasty, defeated Pu Chien, ruler of the state of Chin, in AD 383 at the Peishui River in Anhwei Province. 
Pu Chien had an infantry force of more than 600,000, a cavalry force of 270,000 and a guards corps of more than 30,000, while the land and river forces of Eastern Tsin numbered only 80,000. 
When the armies lined up on opposite banks of the Peishui River, Hsieh Hsuan, taking advantage of the overconfidence and conceit of the enemy troops, requested Pu Chien to move his troops back so as to leave room for the Eastern Tsin troops to cross the river and fight it out. 
Pu Chien complied, but when he ordered withdrawal, his troops got into a panic and could not be stopped. 
Seizing the opportunity, the Eastern Tsin troops crossed the river, launched an offensive and crushed the enemy.
^fn30 Nanchang, capital of Kiangsi Province, was the scene of the famous uprising on August l, 1927 led by the Communist Party of China in order to combat the counterrevolution of Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Ching-wei and to continue the revolution of 1924-27. 
More than thirty thousand troops took part in the uprising which was led by Comrades Chou En-lai, Chu The, Ho Lung and Yeh Ting. 
The insurrectionary army withdrew from Nanchang on August 5 as planned, but suffered a defeat when approaching Chaochow and Swatow in Kwangtung Province. 
Led by Comrades Chu Teh, Chen Yi and Lin Piao, part of the troops later fought their way to the Chingkang Mountains and joined forces with the 1st Division of the First Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Army under Comrade Mao Tse-tung.
^fn31 See "Why Is It That Red Political Power Can Exist in China?", Note 8, p. 72 of this volume.
^fn32 The famous Autumn Harvest Uprising under the leadership of Comrade Mao Tse-tung was launched in September 1927 by the people's armed forces of Hsiushui, Pinghsiang, Pingkiang and Liuyang Counties on the Hunan-Kiangd border, who formed the 1st Division of the First Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Army. 
Comrade Mao Tse-tung led this force to the Chingkang Mountains where a revolutionary base was established.

^fn36 The "eight-legged essay" was the prescribed form in the imperial competitive examinations in feudal China from the 15th to the 19th century. 
The main body of the essay was made up of the inceptive paragraph, the middle paragraph, the rear paragraph and the concluding paragraph, with each paragraph comprising two parts. 
Here Comrade Mao Tse-tung is using the development of the theme in this kind of essay as a metaphor to illustrate the development of the revolution through its various stages. 
However, Comrade Mao Tse-tung generally uses the term "eight-legged essay" to ridicule dogmatism.
^fn37 In November 1933, under the influence of the people's anti-Japanese upsurge throughout China, the leaders of the Kuomintang's 19th Route Army, in alliance with the Kuomintang forces under Li Chi-shen, publicly renounced Chiang Kai-shek and established the "People's Revolutionary Government of the Republic of China" in Fukien, concluding an agreement with the Red Army to attack Chiang Kai-shek and resist Japan. 
This episode was referred to as the Fukien Incident. 
The 19th Route Army and Fukien People's Government, however, collapsed under the attacks of Chiang Kai-shek's troops.
^c14
^fn1 Under the influence of the Chinese Red Army and the people's anti-Japanese movement, the Kuomintang's Northeastern Army headed by Chang Hsueh-liang and the Kuomintang's 17th Route Army headed by Yang Hu-cheng agreed to the anti-Japanese national united front proposed by the Communist Party of China and demanded that Chiang Kai-shek should unite with the Communist Party to resist Japan. 
He refused, became still more active in his military preparations for the "suppression of the Communists" and massacred young people in Sian who were anti-Japanese. 
Chang Hsueh-liang and Yang Hu-cheng took joint action and arrested Chiang Kai-shek. 
This was the famous Sian Incident of December 12, 1936. 
He was forced to accept the terms of unity with the Communist Party and resistance to Japan, and was then set free to return to Nanking.
^fn2 The Chinese "punitive" group consisted of the pro-Japanese cements in the Kuomintang government in Nanking who tried to wrest power from Chiang Kai-shek during the Sian Incident. 
With Wang Ching-wei and Ho Yiag-chin as their leaders, they advocated a "punitive expedition" against Chang Hsueh-liang and Yang Hu-cheng. 
Availing themselves of the incident, they prepared to start large-scale civil war in order to dear the way for the Japanese invaders and wrest political power from Chiang Kai-shek.
^fn3 Seven leaders of the patriotic anti-Japanese movement in Shanghai had been arrested by Chiang Kai-shek's government in November 1936. 
They were Shen Chun-ju, Chang Nai-chi, Tsou Tao-fen, Li Kung-pu, Sha Chien-li, Shih Liang and Wang Tsao-shih. 
They were kept in prison till July 1937.
^fn4 Wang Ching-wei was the head of the pro-Japanese group in the Kuomintang. 
He had stood for compromise with the Japanese imperialists ever since their invasion of the Northeast in 1931. 
In December 1938 he left Chungking, openly capitulated to the Japanese invaders, and set up a puppet government in Nanking.
^fn5 Ho Ying-chin, a Kuomintang warlord, was another leader of the pro-Japanese group. 
During the Sian Incident he actively plotted civil war by deploying Kuomintang troops for an attack on Shensi along the Lunghai Railway. 
He planned to kill Chiang Kai-shek by bombing Sian, in order to take over Chiang's position.
^fn6 T.V. Soong was a pro-American member of the Kuomintang. 
Championing USA interests he, too, favoured a peaceful settlement of the Sian Incident, because USA imperialism was at loggerheads with Japanese imperialism with which it was then contending for supremacy in the Far East.
^fn7 This letter sternly criticized the Kuomintang's reactionary rule and the decisions of the Second Plenary Session of its Central Executive Committee. 
It also set out the Communist Party's policy of forming an anti-Japanese national united front and renewing its co-operation with the Kuomintang.
The main part of the letter reads: In talking about "centralization and unification", the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee of your party is really confusing cause and effect.
 It must be emphasized that the civil war and disunity of the last ten years have been entirely caused by the disastrous policy of dependence on imperialism pursued by your party and your party's government, and especially the policy of non-resistance to Japan persisted in ever since the Incident of September 18, 1931.
 Under the slogan of "Internal pacification before resistance to foreign invasion", your party and your party's government have been carrying on incessant civil war and launching numerous encirclement campaigns against the Red Army, and have spared no effort in suppressing the patriotic and democratic movements of the people throughout the country.
 Being blind to the fact that Japanese imperialism is China's deadliest enemy, you have had no qualms even in recent months about abandoning northeastern and northern China, you have used all your strength to fight the Red Army and wage factional struggles within your own party, you have blocked the Red Army on its way to fight the Japanese and harassed its rear, you have ignored the nationwide demand for resistance to Japan and have deprived the people of their freedoms and rights.
 Patriotism is penalized and innocent people are in jail everywhere; treason is rewarded and traitors are jubilant over their new appointments and honours.
 To seek centralization and unification by means of this wrong policy is like "climbing a tree to seek fish" and will produce exactly the opposite results.
 We wish to warn you gentlemen that if you do not make a fundamental change in your erroneous policy, and if you do not direct your hatred against the Japanese imperialists but continue to direct it against your own countrymen, you will find it impossible even to maintain the status quo and any talk about centralization, unification and a so-called "modern state" will remain idle chatter.
 What the whole nation demands is centralization and unification for fighting Japan and saving the nation, not for fawning on the foreigners and persecuting our own people.
 The people are now eagerly demanding a government that can really save their country and themselves, a really democratic republic.
 They demand a democratic republican government which will serve their interests.
The programme of such a government must principally provide for:
 first, resistance to foreign aggression;
 second, democratic rights for the people;
 and third, development of the national economy and elimination, or at least alleviation, of the people's sufferings.
 If there is any sense in your talk about a "modern state", this is the only programme genuinely meeting the needs of colonial and semi-colonial China in the present era.
 With eager hopes and firm determination the people are struggling for the realization of these objectives.
 But your party and your party's government are pursuing a policy that runs counter to their hopes and you will never win their confidence.
The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese Red Army hereby solemnly declare: we stand for the resting up of a unified democratic republic for the whole country and the convening of a parliament elected by universal suffrage, and we support an anti-Japanese national salvation congress representative of all the people and all the anti-Japanese armed forces in the country, and a unified national defence government for the whole country.
 We hereby declare: as soon as a unified democratic republic is set up for the whole of China, the Red areas will become one of its component parts, the representatives of the people of the Red areas will attend the all-China parliament, and the same democratic system will be set up in the Red areas as in other parts of China.
 We hold that the national defence council, which the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee of your party has decided to organize, and the national assembly, which your party and your party's government are in process of convening, cannot achieve centralization and unification for resisting Japan and saving the nation.
According to the regulations of the national defence council passed by the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee of your party, this council will be confined to a few officials who hold power in your party and your party's government, and its task is merely to serve as an advisory body to that government.
 It is only too dear that such a council cannot achieve anything or win any confidence among the people.
 The same applies to the national assembly which you gentlemen propose to convene; according to the "Draft Constitution of the Republic of China" and the "Organic Law and Election Law of the National Assembly" passed by your party's government, this assembly will be merely an organ manipulated by a few officials of your party and your party's government, it will be nothing but an appendage for them, or a piece of ornamentation.
 A national defence council and a national assembly of this kind have nothing at all in common with the all-China congress for resistance to Japan and for national salvation--the national defence council--and the Chinese democratic republic and its parliament which our Party has proposed.
We hold that a national defence council for resistance to Japan and national salvation must include representatives of all the political parties and groups, all walks of life and all the armed forces, and must constitute a real organ of authority to decide the major polices for resisting Japan and saving the nation, and that a unified national defence government must be formed from this council.
 The national assembly must be a parliament elected by universal suffrage and the supreme organ of authority of the democratic republic of China.
 Only such a national defence council and such an all-China parliament will win the approval, support and participation of the people of the whole country and place the great cause of saving the nation and the people on a firm, unshakable foundation.
 Mere fine words are useless and will not win the people's approval.
 The failure of the various conferences held by your party and your party's government is the best proof of this.
The declaration of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee of your party stated, "Dangers and obstacles are only to be expected; but we will never, because of the difficulties and troubles that beset the nation, relax in the fulfilment of our duty."
 And again, "As to the survival of the nation, naturally our party will work for it persistently, body and soul."
 True enough, being the ruling party in the largest part of China, your party must bear the political responsibility for all past deeds.
 In view of the fact that the Kuomintang government is a one-party dictatorship, your party can never escape this responsibility.
In particular, you can never shift onto others your responsibility for the loss of almost half of China, resulting from the absolutely wrong policy which your party has pursued since the September 18th Incident against the wishes of all the people and the interests of the whole nation. 
As we and all the people see it, since half of China has been abandoned by your party, it certainly cannot evade its duty of recovering the territory and restoring China's sovereignty.
At the same time, even within your party many men of conscience are now clearly awake to the horrors of national subjugation and the inviolability of the people's will, they are beginning to turn in a new direction and feel indignant and dissatisfied with those in their midst who have brought disaster both to their party and to the nation.
The Chinese Communist Party has full sympathy with this new turn and warmly applauds the noble spirit and awakening of these patriotic and conscientious members of the Kuomintang, their readiness to make sacrifices in the struggle, and their courage to introduce reforms when the nation is on the brink of ruin.
 We know that the number of awakened and patriotic people is increasing daily in your party's central and provincial headquarters, in its central and provincial governments, in educational, scientific, artistic, journalistic and industrial circles, among the women and in religious and medical circles, within the police service, among all kinds of popular organizations, and in particular among the broad ranks of the army and among both old and new Kuomintang members as well as Kuomintang leaders at various levels; this is very heartening.
The Chinese Communist Party is always ready to join hands with these members of the Kuomintang and form a solid national united front with them to fight the nation's deadliest enemy, Japanese imperialism. 
We hope that they will speedily grow into a dominant force in the Kuomintang and prevail over those wicked and shameless members who have ignored the interests of the nation and virtually become Japanese agents and collaborators--members who are a disgrace to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's memory--and we hope that they will thus be able to revive the spirit of Dr. Sun's revolutionary Three People's Principles, reaffirm his Three Great Policies of alliance with Russia, co-operation with the Communist Party and assistance to the peasants and workers, and "work persistently, body and soul" for the realization of the revolutionary Three People's Principles, of the Three Great Policies and of Dr. Sun's revolutionary Testament.
We hope that, together with the patriotic leaders of all political parties and groups and of all walks of life and together with all patriotic people, they will resolutely shoulder the responsibility of continuing Dr. Sun's revolutionary cause and will throw themselves into the struggle to drive out the Japanese imperialists and save the Chinese nation from subjugation, to win democratic rights for the people, to develop China's national economy and free the vast majority of its people from their sufferings, and to bring into being the democratic republic of China with a democratic parliament and democratic government.
The Chinese Communist Party hereby declares to all members of the Kuomintang: "if you really do this, we shall resolutely support you and are ready to form with you a solid revolutionary united front like that of the great revolutionary period of 1924-27 against imperialist and feudal oppression, for this is the only correct way today to save the nation from subjugation and ensure its survival."

^fn1 The Northern China Incident took place in 1935 when the Japanese carried on aggression against northern China and the Kuomintang government headed by Chiang Kai-shek betrayed our sovereignty and humiliated our nation. 
In May of that year, the Japanese demanded that the Kuomintang government grant them administrative authority over northern China, and in June Ho Ying-chin the Kuomintang government's representative there, submitted and signed an agreement with Yoshijiro Umezu, commander of the invading forces in northern China which became known as the "Ho-Umezu Agreement". 
By its terms China forfeited much of her sovereignty in the provinces of Hopei and Chahar. 
In October at the instigation of the Japanese invaders, some Chinese traitors staged a revolt in Hsiangho, Hopei Province, and seized the county town. 
In November, a number of Chinese traitors were put up by the Japanese invaders to start a self-styled movement of autonomy in the five provinces of northern China, and a puppet "Anti-Communist Autonomous Administration" was established in eastern Hopei To meet the Japanese demand for "special administration for northern China" the Kuomintang government appointed Sung Cheh-yuan and others to form a "Political Council for Hopei and Chahar".
^fn2 This declaration was issued by the Chinese Communist Party on August 1, 1935. 
Its main points are contained in the following extracts
"At this moment when our country and our people are threatened with imminent destruction, the Communist Party once again appeals to all fellow countrymen: whatever the past or present differences of political opinion and of interests among the political parties, whatever the differences of view and of interests among our countrymen in their various walks of life, whatever the past or present hostilities between the various armies, we should truly awaken to the realization that 'brothers quarreling at home, join forces against attacks from without' and, first and foremost, we should stop the civil war so as to concentrate the nation's resources (manpower, material and financial resources, and the armed forces) on the fight for the sacred cause of resisting Japan and saving the nation. 
Once again the Communist Party solemnly declares if the Kuomintang troops cease their attacks on the Red Army and if any units carry out resistance to Japan, then the Red Army, regardless of any old feuds or present conflicts or differences on domestic issues, will not only immediately cease its hostile actions against these units, but willingly work closely with them to save the nation."
"The Communist Party is willing to initiate a national defence government of this kind; for the joint formation of such a national defence government it is ready to hold immediate talks with all those willing to join the cause of resisting Japan and saving the nation--all political parties, all organizations (trade unions, peasant associations, student unions, chambers of commerce educational associations, journalists' societies, associations of teachers and other staff of schools, fellow-townsmen's associations, the Chih Kung Tang the Association for National Armed Self-Defence, the Anti-Japanese Association the Association for National Salvation, etc.), all prominent public figures, scholars and statesmen and all local military and administrative bodies The national defence government emerging out of these negotiations should be a provisional organ of leadership for saving the nation from subjugation and ensuring its survival. 
It should endeavour to convene a delegate body truly representative of all our countrymen (with delegates democratically elected by all the various circles of workers, peasants, soldiers, government personnel, businessmen and students, by all parties and all organizations willing to resist Japan and save the nation, and by all overseas Chinese and all the nationalities within China's boundaries) to discuss all problems relating to armed resistance and national salvation in more specific terms. 
The Communist Party will do its very best to help convene such an assembly of representatives of the people and to carry out all its decisions."
"An anti-Japanese united army should be formed of all troops willing to fight Japan. 
A single general headquarters of this army should be set up under the leadership of the national defence government. 
The question of whether this headquarters should be composed of representatives elected by the officers and men of the various anti-Japanese army units or be formed in some other way should be decided by the representatives of all circles and by the will of the people. 
The Red Army will unreservedly be the first to join this united army and fulfil its duty in resisting Japan and saving the nation. 
To enable the national defence government and the anti-Japanese united army effectively to discharge their immense responsibilities for national defence and for resisting Japan, the Communist Party hereby appeals to the whole nation: those who have money give money, those who have guns give guns, those who have grain give grain, those who have labour power give labour power, and those who have special skill contribute special skill, so that all our fellow-countrymen will be mobilized and all weapons, old or modern, will be used to arm the people in millions upon millions."
^fn3 The December resolution was the "Resolution on the Present Political Situation and the Tasks of the Party", adopted at the meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party at Wayaopao, northern Shensi, on December 25, 1935. 
It made a comprehensive analysis of the current internal and international situation and the changes in class relations in China, and formulated the Party's policy. 
The resolution runs in part as follows:
The present situation shows that the attempts of Japanese imperialism to annex China have shocked the whole country and the whole world. 
Changes have taken place or are taking place in the relations between all classes, strata, political parties and armed forces in China's political life. 
There is a realignment of forces in both the national revolutionary front and the national counter-revolutionary front. 
Therefore, the Party's tactical line is to arouse, unite and organize the revolutionary forces throughout the country and among all the nationalities to oppose the chief enemy confronting them, namely, Japanese imperialism and the arch-traitor Chiang Kai-shek. 
All people, all parties, all armed forces and all classes, in so far as they are opposed to Japanese imperialism and the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, should unite and wage the sacred national revolutionary war, drive the Japanese imperialists out of China, overthrow the rule of their running dogs in China, achieve the complete liberation of the Chinese nation and safeguard China's independence and territorial integrity. 
Only by establishing the broadest anti-Japanese national united front (embracing the lower and upper strata) can we defeat Japanese imperialism and its running dog, Chiang Kai-shek. 
Of course, different individuals, different organizations, different social classes and strata and the various armed forces join the anti-Japanese national revolution from different motives and with different class standpoints. 
Some do so in order to hold on to their positions, some to gain leadership in the movement so that it will not go beyond, the limits they allow, and some genuinely to work for the complete liberation of the Chinese nation. 
Precisely because their motives and their standpoint differ, some will vacillate or turn traitor at the very start of the struggle, some will become indifferent or withdraw from the fight midway and some will determinedly fight to the end. 
Nevertheless, our task is to unite not only al possible basic forces but also all potential allies likely to resist Japan and enable the people throughout the country who have labour power to give labour power, those who have money to give money, those who have guns to give guns, and those who have knowledge to contribute knowledge, leaving no patriotic Chinese outside the anti-Japanese front. 
Such is the general line of e Party's tactics for the broadest possible national united front. 
Only by pursuing this line can we mobilize the forces of the whole people to deal with the common enemy, Japanese imperialism and the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. 
The Chinese working class and peasantry remain the basic motive forces of the Chinese revolution. 
The broad masses of the petty bourgeoisie and the revolutionary intellectuals are their most reliable allies in the national revolution A solid alliance of the workers, the peasants and the petty bourgeoisie is the basic force for defeating Japanese imperialism and the traitors and collaborators When a section of the national bourgeoisie and the warlords gives moral support, maintains benevolent neutrality or directly participates in the struggle against Japan and the traitors and collaborators, this will serve to expand the anti-Japanese front, however much it may disapprove of the agrarian revolution an Red political power. 
For the total strength of the counter-revolution will thus be reduced and the total strength of the revolution increased. 
To this end the Party should adopt appropriate ways and means to win these forces over to the anti-Japanese front. 
Moreover, unity is by no means prevalent even in the camp of the landlord and comprador classes. 
Since the contention for China among many imperialist powers has generated contending groups of traitors in their service with contradictions and conflicts among them, the Party should employ a variety of methods to ensure that for the time being some of these counter-revolutionary forces do not actively oppose the anti-Japanese front The same tactics should be applied in dealing with the imperialist powers other than Japan. 
In arousing, uniting and organizing the forces of the people through out the country to fight the common enemy, the Party should resolutely and unswervingly combat all tendencies towards vacillation, compromise, capitulation and betrayal within the anti-Japanese united front. 
Those who disrupt the Chinese people's anti-Japanese movement are traitors or collaborators whom we should all join in hitting hard. 
The Communist Party should win the leadership of the anti-Japanese front by being resolute and right in its words and deeds against the Japanese imperialists and the traitors and collaborators Only under the Communist Party's leadership can the anti-Japanese movement be completely victorious. 
With regard to the masses in the anti-Japanese war, it is necessary to satisfy their demands in matters affecting their basic interests (the demand of the peasants for land and the demand of the workers the soldiers the urban poor and the intellectuals for better living). 
Only by satisfying their demands will we be able to mobilize still broader sections of the masses to join the anti-Japanese ranks, keep up the anti-Japanese movement, and lead the movement to complete victory. 
And only thus can the Party win leadership in the anti-Japanese war.
See "On Tactics Against Japanese Imperialism", pp. 153 - 78 of this volume.
^fn4 The Red Army sent an open telegram on May 5, 1936 demanding that the Nanking government end the civil war, conduct peace negotiations with the Communists for unity against Japan. 
The text reads as follows:
To the Military Council of the Nanking National Government; to all land, sea and air forces, to all parties, all political groups; all public bodies, all newspapers; and to all fellow-countrymen refusing to be slaves to a foreign nation.
After crossing the Yellow River on its eastward expedition, the Anti-Japanese Vanguard of the Chinese People's Red Army, organized by the Revolutionary Military Commission of the Chinese Red Army, was everywhere victorious and won support from all over the country. 
But when it occupied the Tatung-Puchow Railway and was energetically preparing to drive eastward into Hopei to engage the Japanese imperialists directly, Chiang Kai-shek sent more than ten divisions into Shansi and co-operated with Yen Hsi-shan in barring its advance against the Japanese. 
He also ordered the troops under Chang Hsueh-liang and Yang Hu-cheng, as well as the troops in northern Shensi, to march on the Shensi-Kansu Red area to harass our anti-Japanese rear In order to be able to reach and fight the Japanese, the people's Anti-Japanese Vanguard should have concentrated its entire strength and wiped out Chiang's troops blocking the way. 
But after much deliberation, the Revolutionary Military Commission of the Red Army decided that a battle to the finish between the two sides in the present national crisis would only damage China's strength for national defence and delight the Japanese imperialists, whichever side emerged victorious Furthermore, there are quite a number of patriotic officers and men in Chiang Kai-shek's and Yen Hsi-shan's armies who are willing to end the civil war and unite to resist Japan, and it is really against their consciences to obey Chiang's and Yen's orders and block the Red Army on its way to fight the Japanese. 
Therefore, in spite of its numerous victories in Shansi, the Revolutionary Military Commission of the Red Army has withdrawn the people's Anti-Japanese Vanguard to the west of the Yellow River in order to preserve China's strength for national defence and thereby help to bring nearer the war of resistance against Japan, resolutely carry out our repeated declarations to the nation on ending the civil war and uniting to resist Japan, and hasten the final awakening of Chiang Kai-shek and the patriotic officers and men in his army. 
With this demonstration of our good faith to the Nanking government, to all the country's land, sea and air forces and to the whole nation, we are ready to arrange a cease-fire with all the armed units attacking the and-Japanese Red Army within one month and to enter into peace negotiations with them in order to end the civil war and resist Japan. 
The Revolutionary Military Commission of the Red Army hereby solemnly advises the gentlemen of the Nanking government at this critical juncture, when our country and people are threatened with imminent destruction, to make a determined effort to atone for past misdeeds and end the civil war in the whole country, to join forces against attacks from-without in the spirit of brothers quarreling at home, and first of all end the civil war in Shensi, Kansu and Shansi, whereupon both sides should appoint delegates to discuss specific measures for resisting Japan and saving the nation. 
This will be a blessing to the nation and the country as well as for your own good. 
However, if you obstinately refuse to listen to reason and prefer to be traitors and collaborators, your rule will surely collapse in the end and you will be spurned and overthrown by the whole nation. 
The old saying runs, "A thousand pointing fingers accuse, and a man dies even without a sickness." Or as another saying goes, "The butcher who lays down his knife at once becomes a Buddha." These are words for you gentlemen to digest and ponder. 
And the Revolutionary Military Commission of the Red Army calls upon all organizations all parties and all people in the country, who refuse to be slaves to a foreign nation, to support our proposal for a cease-fire and peace negotiations, and for unity against Japan, to organize committees for hastening the cessation of the civil war and to send representatives to the front to stop the firing on both sides and to supervise the full implementation of this proposal
^fn5 See "A Statement on Chiang Kai-shek's Statement' Note 7, pp. 259-61 of this volume.
^fn6 The slogan of "A people's republic" was first put forward in the "Resolution on the Present Political Situation and the Tasks of the Party", adopted at the meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held in December 1935 and in the report by Comrade Mao Tse-tung "On Tactics Against Japanese Imperialism". 
Later circumstances made it necessary for the Party to adopt the policy of forcing Chiang Kai-shek to resist Japan and, as the slogan would have been unacceptable to the Chiang Kai-shek clique, it was changed into "A democratic republic" in the Party's letter of August 1936 to the Kuomintang The slogan of a democratic republic was subsequently explained in more concrete terms in the "Resolution on the New Situation in the Movement to Resist Japan and Save the Nation, and on the Democratic Republic", which the Central Committee of the Party adopted in September of the same year. 
Though different in form the two slogans are in essence the same. 
The following two extracts concerning the democratic republic are from the September 1936 resolution of the Party's Central Committee:
"The Central Committee holds that in the present situation it is necessary to put forward the slogan of 'establish a democratic republic', because this is the best way to unite all the anti-Japanese forces to safeguard China's territorial integrity and avert the calamity of the destruction of China and of the subjugation of her people, and also because this is the most fitting slogan for the formation of a united front based on the democratic demands of the broad masses of the people. 
By 'a democratic republic' we mean a democracy which is geographically more extensive than that of the workers' and peasants' democratic dictatorship in one part of China and a political system which is far more progressive than the one-party dictatorship of the Kuomintang in the main parts of China; it will therefore offer a better guarantee of the wide development of armed resistance to Japan and the achievement of complete victory. 
Moreover, the democratic republic will not only enable the broadest sections of the Chinese people to take pare in the country's political life and enhance their political consciousness and organized strength, but also give the Chinese proletariat and its leader, the Communist Party, scope for activity in the struggle for the future victory of socialism. 
Therefore, the Chinese Communist Party proclaims its active support of the movement for a democratic republic. 
It also declares that when the democratic republic is established through the length and breadth of China and a parliament elected by universal suffrage is convened the Red areas will at once become an organic part of the republic, the people of the Red areas will elect their representatives to the parliament, and the same democratic system will be put into practice in the Red areas."
"The Central Committee stresses that we shall impel the Kuomintang government m Nanking to resist Japan and we shall create the prerequisites for the democratic republic only by extending the Chinese people's movement of armed resistance and national salvation. 
by broadening the anti-Japanese national united front of all political parties, people of all walks of life and all armies, by strengthening the Chinese Communist Party's's role of political leadership in the national united front, by greatly consolidating the Red political power and the Red Army, and by waging a determined struggle against all words and deeds which betray our sovereignty and humiliate our nation or weaken the forces of the national united front. 
It is impossible for the democratic republic to become a reality without bitter and sustained struggles, without the mobilization of the entire Chinese nation, and without a high tide of revolution. 
In the course of the struggle for the democratic republic, the Chinese Communist Party should insist that the democratic republic should begin by carrying out the Ten-Point Programme for Resisting Japan and Saving the Nation proposed by our Party's and go on until it finally fulfils the basic tasks of the Chinese bourgeois-democratic revolution."
^fn7 This telegram was dispatched on February 10, 1937. 
The full text reads as follows:
To the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang Gentlemen:
It is a matter of national rejoicing that the Sian Incident has been settled peacefully. 
From now on it will be possible for the policy of internal peace and for unity and solidarity against foreign aggression to be carried out; this is a blessing to the nation and the country. 
At this moment when the Japanese invaders are running amuck and the survival of the Chinese nation hangs by a thread, our Party's eagerly hopes that, in accordance with this policy, the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee of your party will decide on the following as the national policy:
(1) end all civil wars and concentrate the country's strength in a united effort to meet the foreign aggression;
(2) guarantee freedom of speech, assembly and association, and release all political prisoners;
(3) call a conference of representatives of all political parties, people of all walks of life and all armies, and concentrate the radon's talents in a common endeavour to save the country;
(4) speedily complete all preparations for resisting Japan; and
(5) improve the livelihood of the people.
If the Third Plenary Session of your Central Executive Committee can succeed in resolutely and firmly deciding on this as the national policy, our Party will pledge the following as an expression of our good faith in solidarity against foreign aggression:
(1) the policy of armed insurrection to overthrow the National Government will be discontinued throughout the country;
(2) the Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government will be renamed the Government of the Special Region of the Republic of China and the he Red Army will be redesignated as part of the National Revolutionary Army, and they will come under the direction of the Central Government t in Nanking and its Military Council respectively;
(3) a thoroughly democratic system based on universal suffrage will be put into effect in the areas under the Government of the Special Region; and
(4) the policy of confiscating the land of the landlords will be discontinued and the common programme of the anti-Japanese national united front resolutely carried out.
^fn8 In November and December 1936, big strikes broke out among 45,000 workers in twenty-six Japanese and Chinese-owned textile mills in Shanghai. 
In December all the workers of the Japanese-owned textile mills in Tsingtao struck in sympathy. 
The Shanghai workers won their strike, their wages were increased five per cent retrospectively from November, and the employers undertook not to sack workers arbitrarily or assault or abuse them. 
But the strike in Tsingtao was suppressed by Japanese marines.
^fn9 Britain and the United States began to change their attitude towards Japan and exerted some influence on the Chiang Kai-shek government in its policy towards Japan after Japanese imperialism occupied Shanhaikuan and penetrated into northern China in 1933, and especially after the conclusion of the "Ho-Umezu Agreement" (see Note I, p. 276) in 1935, which directly jeopardized their imperialist interests in northern and central China. 
During the Sian Incident of 1936, Britain suggested rejection of Japanese demands prejudicial to British interests in China and even intimated that, provided the Chiang Kai-shek government maintained its rule over the Chinese people, it would not be a bad thing for it to "form some sort of alliance with the Communist Party" so as to deal a blow to the Japanese policy of aggression.
^fn10 In June 1936, Li Tsung-jen and Pai Chung-hsi, warlords of Kwangsi, and Chen Chi-tang, warlord of Kwangtung, jointly declared their opposition to Chiang Kai-shek under the pretext of "resisting Japan and saving the nation". 
In August their opposition mated away before Chiang Kai-shek's tactics of bribery and divide and rule.
^fn11 The Japanese forces and puppet troops began to invade Suiyuan in August 1936. 
In November, the Chinese troops there fought back and the people throughout the country started a movement in support of their fight.
^fn12 After the "Ho-Umezu Agreement" of 1935, the Nanking Kuomintang government took a firmer attitude towards Japan under the pressure of the people's rising anti-Japanese sentiment and under the impact of the stiffer policy the British and USA imperialists were adopting towards Japan. 
The Kuomintang government used stalling tactics in the negotiations with Japan from September to December 1936, which ended without result.
^fn13 This was the meeting of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang on February 15,1937 after the peaceful settlement of the Sian Incident.

Ah Q typifies all those who compensate themselves for their failures and setbacks in real life by regarding them as moral or spiritual victories.
^fn15 In the stage of China's bourgeois-democratic revolution, the Communists agreed with the basic points of Sun Yat- sen's programme and co-operated with him, which did not mean that they agreed with the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois world outlook or ideological system of which he was the exponent. 
As the vanguard of the Chinese proletariat, the Chinese Communists had an entirely different world outlook or ideological system and theoretical approach to the national and other problems, from those of Sun Yat-sen,
^fn16 Reorganized by Sun Yat-sen in 1924, the Kuomintang became a revolutionary alliance of several classes, which members of the Communist Party joined in their individual capacity. 
After its betrayal of the revolution in 1927, the Kuomintang carried out what it called a "party purge" throughout the country, butchering the Communists and many of its own left-wingers who genuinely supported Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Great Policies. 
From then on the Kuomintang became the counter-revolutionary political party of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie.
^fn17 This refers to the situation created by the opportunist leadership of the Central Committee of the Party in the first half of 1927.
^c16
^fn1 The Japanese imperialists made temporary conciliatory gestures after the Sian Incident in order to induce the Kuomintang authorities to disrupt the internal peace which was being restored and to break up the anti-Japanese national united front which was taking shape. 
They arranged for the bogus autonomous government of Inner Mongolia under their control to release two messages, one in December 1936 and another in March 1937, pledging allegiance to the Kuomintang government in Nanking. 
And the Japanese foreign minister, Sago himself, publicly wooed Chiang Kai-shek, slyly declaring that Japan would improve its relations with China and help China achieve political unification and economic recovery. 
Furthermore, Japan sent a so-called Economic Study Group, headed by Kenji Kodama, a Japanese financial magnate, ostensibly to help China "complete the organization of a modern state". 
These were schemes for aggression and were known as "Sago's diplomacy"; they were called a "retreat on the part of Japan" by those people who were deluded by the Japanese imperialist make-believe.
^fn2 In "April 1937, the Kuomintang High Court in Soochow tried Shen Chun-ju and six other leaders of the Resist Japan and Save the Nation Movement who had been arrested in November 1936 in Shanghai. 
The charge was "endangering the Republic", the usual trumped-up indictment the reactionary Kuomintang authorities used to stigmatize all patriotic movements.
^fn3 Prior to the Sian Incident, the Northeastern Army was stationed on the border between Shensi and Kansu Provinces and was in direct contact with the Red Army in northern Shensi. 
Greatly influenced by the Red Army, it subsequently staged the coup in Sian. 
In March 1937, the Northeastern Army was forced to go east to Honan and Anhwei Provinces, a move taken by the Kuomintang reactionaries to cut it off from contact with the Red Army and at the same time to sow discord in its ranks.
^fn4 General Yang Hu-cheng was a military leader in China's Northwest who staged the Sian Incident together with Chang Hsueh-liang. 
Thus the prime movers in this incident were popularly linked together in the double-barrelled surname "Chang-Yang". 
When Chiang Kai-shek was released. 
Chang accompanied him to Nanking but was immediately placed under detention. 
In April 1937 Yang, too, was ousted from his post by the Kuomintang reactionaries and had to take leave of absence abroad. 
When the War of Resistance began, Yang returned to China to offer his services, only to be interned by Chiang Kai-shek for the rest of his life In September 1949, when the People's Liberation Army was driving forward near Chungking, the Kuomintang had him murdered in a concentration camp.
^fn5 Tungkuan is a strategically important gateway on the borders of Shensi, Honan and Shansi. 
At the time of the Sian Incident the Kuomintang troops were mainly quartered east of it. 
Certain reputedly "Left" people in the Party, like Chang Kuo-tao, then urged that the Red Army should "fight its way out through Tungkuan", which meant that the Red Army should mount an offensive against the Kuomintang troops. 
This proposal ran counter to the Central Committee's policy for a peaceful settlement of the Sian Incident.
^fn6 For a long time after the October Revolution, the French imperialists pursued a hostile policy towards the Soviet Union. 
From 1918 to 1920, the French government took an active part in the armed intervention by 14 powers against the Soviet Union and continued its reactionary policy of isolating the Soviet Union even after the intervention failed. 
It was not until May 1935 that, under the influence of the Soviet Union's peace policy among the French people and because of the German fascist menace, France concluded a treaty of mutual assistance with the Soviet Union, though her reactionary government failed to observe it.
^fn7 The students' patriotic demonstration in Peking on December 9, 1935, led by the Chinese Communist Party. 
The movement called for the cessation of civil war and armed resistance to Japan and won nation-wide support.

^fn12 See J. V. Stalin, "Address Delivered in the Kremlin Palace to the Graduates from the Red Army Academies" in May 1935, in which he said: "… of all the valuable capital the world possesses, the most valuable and most decisive is people, cadres. 
It must be realized that under our present conditions 'cadres decide everything.'"
^fn13 This difference was between the line of the Party's Central Committee and Chang Kuo-tao's line of retreat in 1935-36. 
See "On Tactics Against Japanese Imperialism", Note 22, pp. 175-76 of this volume. 
In stating that "the earlier difference … has … been settled", Comrade Mao Tse-tung was referring to the fact that the Fourth Front Army of the Red Army had joined forces with the Central Red Army. 
Chang Kuo-tao's subsequent open betrayal of the Party and his degeneration into a counter-revolutionary was the act of an individual traitor and no longer a question of differences over Party line.

﻿^v2 THE PERIOD OF THE WAR OF RESISTANCE AGAINST JAPAN (1)
^c19
^fn1 On July 7, 1937, the Japanese invading forces attacked the Chinese garrison at Lukouchiao, some ten kilometres southwest of Peking. 
Under the influence of the ardent nation-wide anti-Japanese movement, the Chinese troops put up resistance. 
This incident marked the beginning of the Chinese people's heroic War of Resistance Against Japan which lasted for eight years.
^fn2 The 28th Army, which was originally part of the Kuomintang's Northwestern Army under Feng Yu-hsiang, was then stationed in Hopei and Chahar Provinces. 
Sung Cheh-yuan was its commander and Feng Chih-an one of its divisional commanders.
^fn3 The Kuomintang government promulgated the so-called "Emergency Decree for Dealing with Actions Endangering the Republic" on January 31, 1931, using the trumped-up charge of "endangering the Republic" to persecute and slaughter patriots and revolutionaries. 
This decree imposed extremely brutal measures of persecution.
^fn4 "Press Censorship Regulations" was another name for the "General Measures for Press Censorship" issued by the Kuomintang government in August 1934 to stifle the voice of the people. 
They laid down that "all news copy must be submitted to censorship".

^fn1 The year 1935 witnessed a new upsurge in the popular patriotic movement throughout the country. 
Students in Peking, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, held a patriotic demonstration on December 9, putting forward such slogans as "Stop the civil war and unite to resist foreign aggression" and "Down with Japanese imperialism". 
This movement broke through the long reign of terror imposed by the Kuomintang government in league with the Japanese invaders and very quickly won the people's support throughout the country. 
It is known as the "December 8th Movement". 
The outcome was that new changes manifested themselves in the relations among the various classes in the country, and the Anti-Japanese National United Front proposed by the Communist Party of China became the openly advocated policy of all patriotic people. 
The Chiang Kai-shek government with its traitorous policy became very isolated.

^fn4 The defence of Madrid, starting in October 1936, lasted for two years and five months. 
In 1936, fascist Germany and Italy made use of the Spanish fascist warlord Franco to launch a war of aggression against Spain. 
The Spanish people, led by the Popular Front Government, heroically defended democracy against aggression. 
The battle of Madrid, the capital of Spain, was the bitterest in the whole war. 
Madrid fell in March 1939 because Britain, France and other imperialist countries assisted the aggressors by their hypocritical policy of "non-intervention" and because divisions arose within the Popular Front.
^fn5 The Three People's Principles were the principles and the programme put forward by Sun Yat-sen on the questions of nationalism, democracy and people's livelihood in China's bourgeois-democratic revolution. 
In the manifesto adopted by the Kuomintang at its First National Congress in 1924 Sun Yat-sen restated the Three People's Principles. 
Nationalism was interpreted as opposition to imperialism and active support was expressed for the movements of the workers and peasants. 
Thus the old Three People's Principles were transformed into the new Three People's Principles characterized by the Three Great Policies, that is, alliance with Russia, co-operation with the Communist Party, and assistance to the peasants and workers. 
The new Three People's Principles provided the political basis for the co-operation between the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang during the First Revolutionary Civil War period.

^fn1 This refers to the "Resolution on the Present Situation and the Tasks of the Party" adopted by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party at its meeting in Lochuan, northern Shensi, on August 25, 1937. 
The full text reads as follows:
(1) The military provocation by the Japanese aggressors at Lukouchiao and their occupation of Peiping and Tientsin represent only the beginning of their large-scale invasion of China south of the Great Wall. 
They have already begun their national mobilization for war. 
Their propaganda that they have "no desire to aggravate the situation"is only a smokescreen for further attacks.
(2) Under the pressure of the Japanese aggressors' attacks and the Chinese people's indignation, the Nanking government is beginning to make up its mind to fight. 
General defence arrangements and actual resistance in some places have already started. 
Full-scale war between China and Japan is inevitable. 
The resistance at Lukouchiao on July 7 marked the starting point of China's national war of resistance.
(3) Thus a new stage has opened in China's political situation, the stage of actual resistance. 
The stage of preparation for resistance is over. 
In the present stage the central task is to mobilize all the nation's forces for victory in the War of Resistance. 
The winning of democracy, which was not accomplished in the previous stage because of the Kuomintang's unwillingness and the inadequate mobilization of the people, is a task that must be fulfilled in the course of the struggle for victory in the War of Resistance.
(4) Our differences and disputes with the Kuomintang and other anti-Japanese groups in this new stage are no longer about whether to wage war of resistance but about how to win victory.
(5) The key to victory in the war now lies in developing the resistance that has already begun into a war of total resistance by the whole nation. 
Only through such a war of total resistance can final victory be won. 
The Ten-Point Programme for Resisting Japan and Saving the Nation now proposed by our Party spells out concretely the way to win final victory in the War of Resistance.
(6) A great danger lurks in the present state of resistance. 
The main reason for this danger is that the Kuomintang is still unwilling to arouse the whole people to take part in the war. 
Instead, it regards the war as the concern of the government alone, and at every turn fears and restricts the people's participation in the war, prevents the government and the army from forming close ties with the people, denies the people the democratic right to resist Japan and save the nation, and refuses to reform the government apparatus thoroughly and to turn the government into a national defence government of the whole nation. 
A war of resistance of this kind may achieve partial victories, but never final victory. 
On the contrary, it may end in grievous failure.
(7) The existence of serious weaknesses in the War of Resistance may lead to many setbacks, retreats, internal splits, betrayals, temporary and partial compromises and other such reverses. 
Therefore it should be realized that the war will be an arduous and protracted war. 
But we are confident that, through the efforts of our Party and the whole people, the resistance already started will sweep aside all obstacles and continue to advance and develop. 
We must overcome all difficulties and firmly fight for the realization of the Ten-Point Programme for victory proposed by our Party. 
We must firmly oppose all wrong policies which run counter to it and combat national defeatism and the pessimism and despair it engenders.
(8) Together with the people and the armed forces under the leadership of the Party, members of the Communist Party must actively take their stand in the forefront of the struggle, become the core of the nation's resistance and do their utmost to develop the anti-Japanese mass movement. 
They must never for a moment relax or miss a single opportunity to do propaganda among the masses and to organize and arm them. 
Victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan will be certain provided the masses in their millions are really organized in the national united front.
^fn2 In the initial period of the War of Resistance, the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek made a number of promises to introduce various reforms under popular pressure, but very quickly broke them one after another. 
The possibility that the Kuomintang might introduce the reforms desired by the whole people was not actualized. 
As Comrade Mao Tse-tung said later in "On Coalition Government":
All the people, including the Communists and other democrats, earnestly hoped that the Kuomintang government would seize the opportunity, at a time when the nation was in peril and the people were filled with enthusiasm, to institute democratic reforms and put Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary Three People's Principles into practice. 
But their hopes came to nought. 
(See Selected Work of Mao Tse-tung, Eng. ed., FLP, Peking, 1965, Vol. III, p. 263.)
^fn3 The Lushan Training Course was set up by Chiang Kai-shek at Lushan, Kiangsi Province, to train high and middle-ranking officials of the Kuomintang party and government to form the core of his reactionary regime.
^fn4 Chang Nai-chi was then advocating "issuing fewer calls and offering more suggestions". 
But it would have been useless merely to submit "suggestions" to the Kuomintang, since it was following a policy of oppression. 
Calls had to be made directly to the masses, in order to arouse them to struggle against the Kuomintang. 
Otherwise, it would have been impossible to keep up the war against Japan or to resist Kuomintang reaction. 
Chang Nai-chi was wrong on this point, and gradually he realized his mistake.
^fn5 This refers to the "Draft Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Concerning the Communist Party's Participation in the Government" which was drawn up on September 25, 1937. 
The full text reads as follows:
(1) The present situation in the anti-Japanese war urgently requires a united front government representing the whole nation, for only such a government can effectively lead the anti-Japanese national revolutionary war and defeat Japanese imperialism. 
The Communist Party is ready to participate in such a government, that is, to undertake administrative responsibilities in the government directly and officially and play an active part in it. 
But such a government does not yet exist. 
What exists today is still the government of the Kuomintang one-party dictatorship.
(2) The Communist Party of China can participate in the government only when it is changed from a one-party dictatorship of the Kuomintang into a united front government of the whole nation, that is, when the present Kuomintang government (a) accepts the fundamentals of the Ten-Point Programme for Resisting Japan and Saving the Nation proposed by our Party and promulgates an administrative programme in accordance therewith; (b) begins to show by deeds the sincerity of its efforts to carry out this programme and achieves definite results; and (c) permits the legal existence of Communist Party organizations and guarantees the Communist Party freedom to mobilize, organize and educate the masses.
(3) Before the Central Committee of the Party decides to participate in the Central Government, members of the Communist Party must not as a rule participate in any local government or in any administrative councils or committees attached to the administrative organs of the government, central or local. 
For such participation would only obscure the distinctive features of the Communist Party, prolong the Kuomintang's dictatorship and hinder rather than help the effort to bring a unified democratic government into being.
(4) However, members of the Communist Party may participate in the local governments of certain particular regions, such as battle areas, where the old authorities find it impossible to rule as before and are on the whole willing to put the Communist Party's policies into effect, where the Communist Party is free to operate openly, and where the present emergency makes Communist participation a necessity in the opinion both of the people and of the government. 
Still more so in the Japanese-occupied areas, the Communist Party should come forward openly as the organizer of the anti-Japanese united front governments.
(5) Before the Communist Party officially joins the government, it is permissible in principle for Party members to participate in representative bodies, such as an all-China national assembly, for the purpose of discussing a democratic constitution and policies to save the nation. 
Thus, the Communist Party should strive to get its members elected to such assemblies and use them as a forum for propagating the Party's views, so as to mobilize the people and rally them round the Party and promote the establishment of a unified democratic government.
(6) Given a definite common programme and the principle of absolute equality, the Central Committee of the Communist Party or its local branches may form united front organizations with the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang or its local headquarters, such as various joint committees (eg, national revolutionary leagues, committees for mass movements and committees for mobilization in the war zones), and through such joint activities the Communist Party should achieve co-operation with the Kuomintang.
(7) With the redesignation of the Red Army as part of the National Revolutionary Army and the change of the organ of Red political power into the Government of the Special Region, their representatives may, by virtue of the legal status they have acquired, join all the military and mass organizations which further the resistance to Japan and the salvation of the nation.
(8) It is most essential to maintain absolutely independent Communist Party leadership in what was originally the Red Army and in all the guerrilla units, and Communists must not show any vacillation on this matter of principle.
^fn6 "Parliamentarism" here refers to the proposal of some Party comrades that the system of political power in the revolutionary base areas, the system of people's representative conferences, should be changed into the bourgeois parliamentary system.
^fn7 The Ho Ming Incident took place after the outbreak of the anti-Japanese war. 
In October 1934, when the Central Red Army moved northward, Red Army guerrilla units stayed behind and maintained guerrilla warfare in extremely difficult circumstances in fourteen areas in the eight southern provinces of Kiangsi, Fukien, Kwangtung, Hunan, Hupeh, Honan, Chekiang and Anhwei. 
When the anti-Japanese war began, these units, acting on instructions from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, entered into negotiations with the Kuomintang for the cessation of civil war and organized themselves into a single army (namely, the New Fourth Army which later stubbornly fought the Japanese on the southern and northern banks of the Yangtse River) and moved to the front to resist Japan. 
But Chiang Kai-shek plotted to exploit these negotiations for the purpose of wiping out the guerrilla units. 
Ho Ming was one of the guerrilla leaders in the Fukien-Kwangtung border area which was one of the fourteen guerrilla areas. 
He was not on the alert against Chiang Kai-shek's plot, with the result that more than one thousand of the guerrillas under his command were surrounded and disarmed by the Kuomintang forces after they assembled.
^fn8 Founded in Yenan in 1937, the Liberation Weekly was the organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. 
It was superseded by the Liberation Daily in 1941.
^fn9 They were that section of the national bourgeoisie for whom newspapers like the Shanghai Shen Pao served as a vehicle.
^fn10 The Pu Hsing Society and the C.C. 
Clique, two fascist organizations within the Kuomintang, were headed by Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Li-fu respectively. 
They served the oligarchic interests of the big landlords and the big bourgeoisie. 
But many petty-bourgeois elements had joined them under compulsion or had been duped into joining. 
The text refers to the section of the Fu Hsing Society consisting mainly of lower and middle-ranking officers in the Kuomintang army and to the section of the C.C. 
Clique consisting mainly of members not in power.
^c25
^fn1 The Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region was the revolutionary base area which was gradually built up after 1931 through revolutionary guerrilla war in northern Shensi. 
When the Central Red Army arrived in northern Shensi after the Long March, it became the central base area of the revolution and the seat of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. 
It was named the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region after the formation of the Anti-Japanese National United Front in 1937, and it included twenty-three counties along the common borders of the three provinces.
^fn2 By 1936 most places in the Border Region had carried out the policy of confiscating the land of the landlords and distributing it among the peasants and cancelling the old debts of the peasants. 
After 1936, in order to facilitate the formation of a broad anti-Japanese national united front, the Chinese Communist Party changed its policy for the country as a whole to one of reduction of rent and interest; at the same time, however, it resolutely protected the gains already secured by the peasants in the land reform.

^fn1 The Changpai mountain range is situated on the northeastern border of China. 
After the Japanese invasion on September 18, 1931, the region became a base area for the anti-Japanese guerrillas led by the Chinese Communist Party.
^fn2 The Wutai mountain range is situated on the borders between Shansi, Hopei and what was then Chahar Province. 
In October 1937 the Eighth Route Army led by the Chinese Communist Party started building the Shansi-Chahar-Hopei anti-Japanese base area with the Wutai mountain region as its centre.
^fn3 The Taihang mountain range is situated on the borders between Shansi, Hopei and Honan Provinces. 
In November 1937 the Eighth Route Army started building the southeastern Shansi anti-Japanese base area with the Taihang mountain region as its centre.
^fn4 The Taishan Mountain is one of the chief peaks of the Tai-Yi mountain range in central Shantung. 
In the winter of 1937 the guerrilla forces led by the Communist Party started building the central Shantung anti-Japanese base area with the Tai-Yi mountain region as its centre.
^fn5 The Yenshan mountain range is situated on the border of Hopei and what was then Jehol Province. 
In the summer of 1938 the Eighth Route Army started building the eastern Hopei anti-Japanese base area with the Yenshan mountain region as its centre.
^fn6 The Maoshan Mountains are in southern Kiangsu. 
In June 1938 the New Fourth Army led by the Communist Party started building the southern Kiangsu anti-Japanese base area with the Maoshan mountain region as its centre.
^fn7 Experience gained in the War of Resistance proved that it was possible to establish long-term and, in many places, stable base areas in the plains. 
This was due to their vastness and big populations, the correctness of the Communist Party's policies, the extensive mobilization of the people and the enemy's shortage of troops. 
Comrade Mao Tse-tung affirmed this possibility more definitely in later directives.
^fn8 Ever since the end of World War II, the national and democratic revolutionary movement has been surging forward in Asia, Africa and Latin America. 
In many countries the people, led by their own revolutionary and progressive forces, have carried on sustained armed struggles to overthrow the dark rule of imperialism and reaction. 
This demonstrates that in the new historical circumstances--when the socialist camp, the revolutionary forces of the people in the colonial countries and the forces of the people striving for democracy and progress in all countries are taking giant strides forward, when the world capitalist system is weakening still further, and when the colonial rule of imperialism is heading for disintegration--the conditions under which the people of various countries conduct guerrilla warfare today need not be quite the same as those which were necessary in the days of the guerrilla warfare waged by the Chinese people against Japan. 
In other words, guerrilla war can be victoriously waged in a county which is not large in territory, as for instance, in Cuba, Algeria, Laos and southern Viet Nam.
^fn9 Weichi is an old Chinese game, in which the two players try to encircle each ocher's pieces on the board. 
When a player's pieces are encircled, they are counted as "dead" (captured). 
But if there is a sufficient number of blank spaces among the encircled pieces, then the latter are still "alive" (not captured).
^fn10 In 353 BC the state of Wei laid siege to Hantan, capital of the state of Chao. 
The king of the state of Chi, an ally of Chao, ordered his generals Tien Chi and Sun Pin to aid Chao with their troops. 
Knowing that the crack forces of Wei had entered Chao and left their own territory weakly garrisoned, General Sun Pin attacked the state of Wei whose troops withdrew to defend their own country. 
Taking advantage of their exhaustion, the troops of Chi engaged and routed them at Kueiling (northeast of the present Horse County in Shantung). 
The siege of Hanean, capital of Chao, was thus lifted. 
Since then Chinese strategists have referred to similar tactics as "relieving the state of Chao by besieging the state of Wei".
^c27
^fn1 This theory of national subjugation was the view held by the Kuomintang. 
The Kuomintang was unwilling to resist Japan and fought Japan only under compulsion. 
After the Lukouchiao Incident (July 7, 1937), the Chiang Kai-shek clique reluctantly took part in the War of Resistance, while the Wang Ching-wei clique became the representatives of the theory of national subjugation, was ready to capitulate to Japan and in fact subsequently did so. 
However, the idea of national subjugation not only existed in the Kuomintang, but also affected certain sections of the middle strata of society and even certain backward elements among the labouring people. 
As the corrupt and impotent Kuomintang government lost one battle after another and the Japanese troops advanced unchecked to the vicinity of Wuhan in the first year of the War of Resistance, some backward people became profoundly pessimistic.
^fn2 These views were to be found within the Communist Party. 
During the first six months of the War of Resistance, there was a tendency to take the enemy lightly among some members of the Party, who held the view that Japan could be defeated at a single blow. 
It was not that they felt our own forces to be so strong, since they well knew that the troops and the organized people's forces led by the Communist Party were still small, but that the Kuomintang had begun to resist Japan. 
In their opinion, the Kuomintang was quite powerful, and, in co-ordination with the Communist Party, could deal Japan telling blows. 
They made this erroneous appraisal because they saw only one aspect of the Kuomintang, that it was resisting Japan, but overlooked the other aspect, that it was reactionary and corrupt.
^fn3 Such was the view of Chiang Kai-shek and company. 
Though they were compelled to resist Japan, Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang pinned their hopes solely on prompt foreign aid and had no confidence in their own strength, much less in the strength of the people.
^fn4 Taierhchuang is a town in southern Shantung where the Chinese army fought a battle in March 1938 against the Japanese invaders. 
By pitting 400,000 men against Japan's 70,000 to 80,000, the Chinese army defeated the Japanese.
^fn5 This view was put forward in an editorial in the Ta King Pao, then the organ of the Political Science Group in the Kuomintang. 
Indulging in wishful thinking, this clique hoped that a few more victories of the Taierhchuang type would stop Japan's advance and that there would be no need to mobilize the people for a protracted war which would threaten the security of its own class. 
This wishful thinking then pervaded the Kuomintang as a whole.
^fn6 For many decades, beginning with the end of the 18th century, Britain exported an increasing quantity of opium to China. 
This traffic not only subjected the Chinese people to drugging but also plundered China of her silver. 
It aroused fierce opposition in China. 
In 1840, under the pretext of safeguarding its trade with China, Britain launched armed aggression against her. 
The Chinese troops led by Lin Tse-hsu put up resistance, and the people in Canton spontaneously organized the "Quell-the-British Corps", which dealt serious blows to the British forces of aggression. 
In 1842, however, the corrupt Ching regime signed the Treaty of Nanking with Britain. 
This treaty provided for the payment of indemnities and the cession of Hongkong to Britain, and stipulated that Shanghai, Foochow, Amoy, Ningpo and Canton were to be opened to British trade and that tariff rates for British goods imported into China were to be jointly fixed by China and Britain.
^fn7 The Taiping Revolution, or the Movement of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, was the mid-19th century revolutionary peasant movement against the feudal rule and national oppression of the Ching Dynasty. 
In January 1851 Hung Hsiu-chuan, Yang Hsiu-ching and other leaders launched an uprising in Chintien Village in Kueiping County, Kwangsi Province, and proclaimed the founding of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. 
Proceeding northward from Kwangsi, their peasant army attacked and occupied Hunan and Hupoh in 1852. 
In 1853 it marched through Kiangsi and Anhwei and captured Nanking. 
A section of the forces then continued the drive north and pushed on to the vicinity of Tientsin. 
However, the Taiping army failed to build stable base areas in the places it occupied; moreover, after establishing its capital in Nanking, its leading group committed many political and military errors. 
Therefore it was unable to withstand the combined onslaughts of the counter-revolutionary forces of the Ching government and the British, USA and French aggressors, and was finally defeated in 1864.
^fn8 The Reform Movement of 1898, whose leading spirits were Kang Yu-wei, Liang Chi-chao and Tan Szu-tung, represented the interests of the liberal bourgeoisie and the enlightened landlords. 
The movement was favoured and supported by Emperor Kuang Hsu, but had no mass basis. 
Yuan Shih-kai, who had an army behind him, betrayed the reformers to Empress Dowager Tzu Hsi, the leader of the die-hards, who seized power again and had Emperor Kuang Hsu imprisoned and Tan Szu-tung and five others beheaded. 
Thus the movement ended in tragic defeat.
^fn9 The Revolution of 1911 was the bourgeois revolution which overthrew the autocratic regime of the Ching Dynasty. 
On October 10 of that year, a section of the Ching Dynasty's New Army who were under revolutionary influence staged an uprising in Wuchang, Hupeh Province. 
The existing bourgeois and petty-bourgeois revolutionary societies and the broad masses of the workers, peasants and soldiers responded enthusiastically, and very soon the rule of the Ching Dynasty crumbled. 
In January 1912, the Provisional Government of the Republic of China was set up in Nanking, with Sun Yat-sen as the Provisional President. 
Thus China's feudal monarchic system which had lasted for more than two thousand years was brought to an end. 
The idea of a democratic republic had entered deep in the hearts of the people. 
But the bourgeoisie which led the revolution was strongly conciliationist in nature. 
It did not mobilize the peasant masses on an extensive scale to crush the feudal rule of the landlord class in the countryside, but instead handed state power over to the Northern warlord Yuan Shih-kai under imperialist and feudal pressure. 
As a result, the revolution ended in defeat.
^fn10 The Northern Expedition was the punitive war against the Northern warlords launched by the revolutionary army which marched north from Kwangtung Province in May-July 1926. 
The Northern Expeditionary Army, with the Communist Party of China taking part in its leadership and under the Party's influence (the political work in the army was at that time mostly under the charge of Communist Party members), gained the warm support of the broad masses of workers and peasants. 
In the second half of 1926 and the first half of 1927 it occupied most of the provinces along the Yangtse and Yellow Rivers and defeated the Northern warlords. 
In April 1927 this revolutionary war failed as a result of betrayal by the reactionary clique under Chiang Kai-shek within the revolutionary army.
^fn11 On January 16, 1938, the Japanese cabinet declared in a policy statement that Japan would subjugate China by force. 
At the same time it tried by threats and blandishments to make the Kuomintang government capitulate, declaring that if the Kuomintang government "continued to plan resistance", the Japanese government would foster a new puppet regime in China and no longer accept the Kuomintang as "the other party" in negotiations.
^fn12 The capitalists referred to here are chiefly those of the United States.
^fn13 By "their governments" Comrade Mao Tse-tung is here referring to the governments of the imperialist countries--Britain, the United States and France.
^fn14 Comrade Mao Tse-tung's prediction that there would be an upswing in China during the stage of stalemate in the War of Resistance Against Japan was completely confirmed in the case of the Liberated Areas under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. 
But there was actually a decline instead of an upswing in the Kuomintang areas, because the ruling clique headed by ChiangKai-shek was passive in resisting Japan and active in opposing the Communist Party and the people. 
This roused opposition among the broad masses of the people and raised their political consciousness
^fn15 According to the theory that "weapons decide everything", China which was inferior to Japan in regard to arms was bound to be defeated in the war. 
This view was current among all the leaders of the Kuomintang reaction, Chiang Kai-shek included.
^fn16 See "Problems of Strategy in Guerrilla War Against Japan", Note 9, p. 112 of this volume.
^fn17 Sun Wu-kung is the monkey king in the Chinese novel Hsi Yu Chi (Pilgrimage to the West), written in the 16th century. 
He could cover 108,000 li by turning a somersault. 
Yet once in the palm of the Buddha, he could not escape from it, however many somersaults he turned. 
With a flick of his palm Buddha transformed his fingers into the five-peak Mountain of Five Elements, and buried Sun Wu-kung.
^fn18 "Fascism is unbridled chauvinism and predatory war," said Comrade Georgi Dimitrov in his report to the Seventh World Congress of the Communist International in August 1935, entitled "The Fascist Offensive and the Tasks of the Communist International" (see Selected Articles and Speeches, Eng. ed., Lawrence & Wishart London, 1951, p. 44). 
In July 1937, Comrade Dimitrov published an article entitled Fascism Is War.

^fn21 Chengpu, situated in the southwest of the present Chuancheng County in Shantung Province, was the scene of a great battle between the states of Tsin and Chu in 632 BC. 
At the beginning of the battle the Chu troops got the upper hand. 
The Tsin troops, after making a retreat of 90 li, chose the right and left flanks of the Chu troops, their weak spots, and inflicted heavy defeats on them.
^fn22 The ancient town of Chengkeo, in the northwest of the present Chengkao County, Honan Province, was of great military importance. 
It was the scene of battles fought in 203 BC between Liu Pang, King of Han, and Hsiang Yu, King of Chu. 
At first Hsiang Yu captured Hsingyang and Chengkao and Liu Pang's troops were almost routed. 
Liu Pang waited until the opportune moment when Hsiang Yu's troops were in midstream crossing the Szeshui River, and then crushed them and recaptured Chengkao.
^fn23 In 204 BC, Han Hsin, a general of the state of Han, led his men in a big battle with Chao Hsieh at Chinghsing. 
Chao Hsieh's army, said to be 200,000 strong, was several times that of Han. 
Deploying his troops with their backs to a river, Han Hsin led them in valiant combat, and at the same time dispatched some units to attack and occupy the enemy's weakly garrisoned rear. 
Caught in a pincer, Chao Hsieh's troops were utterly defeated.
^fn24 The ancient town of Kunyang, in the north of the present Yehhsien County, Honan Province, was the place where Liu Hsiu, founder of the Eastern Han Dynasty, defeated the troops of Wang Mang, Emperor of the Hsin Dynasty, in AD 23. 
There was a huge numerical disparity between the two sides, Liu Hsiu's forces totalling 8,000 to 9,000 men as against Wang Mang's 400,000. 
But taking advantage of the negligence of Wang Mang's generals, Wang Hsun and Wang Yi, who underestimated the enemy, Liu Hsiu with only three thousand picked troops put Wang Mang's main forces to rout. 
He followed up this victory by crushing the rest of the enemy troops.
^fn25 Kuantu was in the northeast of the present Chungmou County, Honan Province, and the scene of the battle between the armies of Tsao Tsao and Yuan Shao in A D 200. 
Yuan Shao had an army of 100,000, while Tsao Tsao had only a meagre force and was short of supplies. 
Taking advantage of the lack of vigilance on the part of Yuan Shao's troops, who belittled the enemy, Tsao Tsao dispatched his light-footed soldiers to spring a surprise attack on them and set their supplies on fire. 
Yuan Shao's army was thrown into confusion and its main force wiped out.
^fn26 The state of Wu was ruled by Sun Chuan, and the state of Wei by Tsao Tsao. 
Chihpi is situated on the south bank of the Yangtse River, to the northeast of Chisyu, Hupeh Province. 
In AD 208 Tsao Tsao led an army of over 500,000 men, which he proclaimed to be 800,000 strong, to launch an attack on Sun Chuan. 
The latter, in alliance with Tsao Tsao's antagonist Liu Pei, mustered a force of 30,000. 
Knowing that Tsao Tsao's army was plagued by epidemics and was unaccustomed to action afloat, the allied forces of Sun Chuan and Liu Pei set fire to Tsao Tsao's fleet and crushed his army.
^fn27 Yiling, to the east of the present Ichang, Hupeh Province, was the place where Lu Sun, a general of the state of Wu, defeated the army of Liu Pei, ruler of Shu, in A D. 222. 
Liu Pei's troops scored successive victories at the beginning of the war and penetrated five or six hundred li into the territory of Wu as far as Yiling. 
Lu Sun, who was defending Yiling, avoided battle for over seven months until Liu Pei "was at his wits' end and his troops were exhausted and demoralized". 
Then he crushed Liu Pei's troops by taking advantage of a favourable wind to set fire to their tents.
^fn28 Hsieh Hsuan, a general of Eastern Tsin Dynasty, defeated Fu Chien, ruler of the state of Chin, in AD 383 at the Feishui River in Anhwei Province. 
Fu Chien had an infantry force of more than 600,000, a cavalry force of 270,000 and a guards corps of more than 30,000, while the land and river forces of Eastern Tsin numbered only 80,000. 
When the armies lined up on opposite banks of the Feishui River, Hsieh Hsuan, taking advantage of the overconfidence and conceit of the enemy troops, requested Fu Chien to move his troops back so as to leave room for the Eastern Tsin troops to cross the river and fight it out. 
Fu Chien complied, but when he ordered withdrawal, his troops got into a panic and could not be stopped. 
Seizing the opportunity, the Eastern Tsin troops crossed the river, launched an offensive and crushed the enemy.
^fn29 In AD 383, Fu Chien, the ruler of the state of Chin, belittled the forces of Tsin and attacked them. 
The Tsin troops defeated the enemy's advance units at Lochien, Shouyang County, Anhwei Province, and pushed forward by land and water. 
Ascending the city wall of Shonyang, Fu Chien observed the excellent alignment of the Tsin troops and, mistaking the woods and bushes on Mount Pakung for enemy soldiers, was frightened by the enemy's apparent strength.
^fn30 Comrade Mao Tse-tung is here referring to the fact that Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Ching-wei, having betrayed the first national democratic united front of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in 1927, launched a ten-year war against the people, and thus made it impossible for the Chinese people to be organized on a large scale. 
For this the Kuomintang reactionaries headed by Chiang Kai-shek must be held responsible.
^fn31 Duke Hsiang of Sung ruled in the Spring and Autumn Era. 
In 638 BC, the state of Sung fought with the powerful state of Chu. 
The Sung forces were already deployed in battle positions when the Chu troops were crossing the river. 
One of the Sung officers suggested that, as the Chu troops were numerically stronger, this was the moment for attack. 
But the Duke said, "No, a gentleman should never attack one who is unprepared." When the Chu troops had crossed the river but had not yet completed their battle alignment, the officer again proposed an immediate aback, and once again the Duke said, "No, a gentleman should never attack an army which has not yet completed its battle alignment." The Duke gave the order for attack on after the Chu troops were fully prepared. 
As a result, the Sung troops met with disastrous defeat and the Duke himself was wounded.
^fn32 Han Pu-chu, a Kuomintang warlord, was for several years governor of Shantun. 
When the Japanese invaders thrust southward to Shantung along the Tientsin-Pukow Railway after occupying Peiping and Tientsin in 1937, Han Fu-chu fled all the was from Shantung to Honan without fighting a single battle.
^fn33 The Kuomintang expanded its army by press-ganging. 
Its military and police seized people everywhere, roping them up and treating them like convicts. 
Those who had money would bribe the Kuomintang officials or pay for substitutes.

^fn1 In his report to the 17th Congress of the CPSU(B) in January 1934, Stalin said: "…after the correct political line has been laid down, organizational work decides everything, including the fate of the political line itself, its success or failure." (See Problems of Leninism, Eng. ed., FLPH, Moscow, 1954, p. 644.) He also dealt with the question of "proper selection of personnel". 
In his address in May 1935 delivered in the Kremlin Palace to the graduates from the Red Army Academies, Stalin put forward and explained the Hogan: "Cadres decide everything." (Ibid., 661-62.) In his report to the 18th Congress of the CPSU,(B) in March 1939, Stalin said: "After a correct political line has been worked out and tested in practice, the Party cadres become the decisive force in the leadership exercised by the Party and the state." (Ibid., p. 784.)
^fn2 The period referred to was that from the emergency meeting of the Political Bureau of the Fifth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in August 1927 to the Fifth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee in January 1934.
^fn3 The Pasi Meeting was called by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee in August 1935 at Pasi, northwest of the county town of Sungpan, on the borders of northwestern Szechuan and southeastern Kansu. 
Chang Kuo-tao, leading a section of the Red Army, had broken away from the Central Committee, and was challenging its orders and attempting to undermine it. 
At this meeting the Central Committee decided to leave the danger zone for northern Shensi with those forces of the Red Army which obeyed its orders. 
However, Chang Kuo-tao led the Red Army units he had deceived southward to the area of Tienchuan, Lushan, the Big and Small Chinchuan and Ahpa, where he established a bogus central committee and came out publicly against the Party.
^fn4 The Yenan Meeting was the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party held in Yenan in April 1937. 
Prior to this meeting large numbers of cadres and soldiers in the Red Army units under Chang Kuo-tao who had already become aware of his deception marched northward towards the Shensi-Kansu border area. 
On their way, however, some units acted on mistaken orders and switched westward to the area of Kanchow, Liangchow and Suchow, all in Kansu Province. 
Most of these were wiped out by the enemy and the rest made their way to Sinkiang and only later returned to the Shensi-Kansu border area. 
The other units had long since reached the Shensi-Kansu border area and joined forces with the Central Red Army. 
Chang Kuo-tao himself also turned up in northern Shensi and attended the Yenan Meeting. 
The meeting systematically and conclusively condemned his opportunism and rebellion against the Party. 
He feigned acquiescence but actually made preparations for his final betrayal of the Party.

^fn2 In 1924, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, in alliance with the Communist Party and the revolutionary workers and peasants, defeated the "Merchants' Corps", an armed force of the compradors and landlords which engaged in counter-revolutionary activities in Canton in collaboration with the British imperialists. 
The revolutionary army, which had been founded on the basis of co-operation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, set out from Canton early in 1925, fought the Eastern Campaign and, with the support of the peasants, defeated the troops of the warlord Chen Chiung-ming. 
It then returned to Canton and overthrew the Yunnan and Kwangsi warlords who had entrenched themselves there. 
That autumn it conducted the Second Eastern Campaign and finally wiped out Chen Chiung-ming's forces. 
These campaigns, in which members of the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League fought heroically in the van, brought about the political unification of Kwangtung Province and paved the way for the Northern Expedition.
^fn3 J. V. Stalin, "The Prospects of the Revolution in China", Works, Eng. ed., FLPH, Moscow, 1954, Vol. VIII, p. 379.
^fn4 In 1894, Dr. Sun Yat-sen formed a small revolutionary organization in Honolulu called the Hsing Chung Hui (Society for China's Regeneration). 
With the support of the secret societies among the people, he staged two armed insurrections in Kwangtung Province against the Ching government after its defeat in the Sino-Japanese war in 1895, one at Canton in 1895 and the other at Huichow in 1900.
^fn5 Tang Meng Hui, or the Chinese Revolutionary League (a united front organization of the bourgeoisie, the petty bourgeoisie and a section of the landed gentry opposed to the Ching government), was formed in 1905 through the merging of the Hsing Chung Hui (see note above) and two other groups, the Hua Hsing Hui (Society for China's Regeneration) and the Kuang Fu Hui (Society for Breaking the Foreign Yoke). 
It put forward a programme of bourgeois revolution advocating "the expulsion of the Tartars (Manchus), the recovery of China, the establishment of a republic and the equalization of landownership". 
In the period of the Chinese Revolutionary League, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, allying himself with the secret societies and a part of the New Army of the Ching government, launched a number of armed insurrections against the Ching regime, notably those at Pinghsiang (Kiangsi Province), Liuyang and Liling (Hunan Province) in 1906, at Huangkang, Chaochow and Chinchow (Kwangtung Province), and at Chennankuan (Kwangsi Province) in 1907, at Hokou (Yunnan Province) in 1908 and at Canton in 1911. 
The last was followed in the same year by the Wuchang Uprising which resulted in the overthrow of the Ching Dynasty.
^fn6 In 1912, the Chinese Revolutionary League was reorganized into the Kuomintang and made a compromise with the Northern warlord regime headed by Yuan Shih-kai. 
In 1913 Yuan's troops marched southward to suppress the forces which had emerged in the provinces of Kiangsi, Anhwei and Kwangtung in the course of the 1911 revolution. 
Armed resistance was organized by Dr. Sun Yat-sen but it was soon crushed. 
In 1914, realizing the error of the Kuomintang's policy of compromise, Dr. Sun formed the Chung Hua Ke Ming Tang (Chinese Revolutionary Party) in Tokyo, Japan, in order to distinguish his organization from the Kuomintang of the time. 
The new Party was actually an alliance of the political representatives of a section of the petty bourgeoisie and a section of the bourgeoisie against Yuan Shih-kai. 
Through this alliance, Dr. Sun Yat-sen staged a minor insurrection in Shanghai in 1914. 
In 1915 when Yuan Shih-kai proclaimed himself emperor, Tsai Ngo and others set out from Yunnan to take action against him, and Dr. Sun was also very active in advocating and promoting armed opposition to Yuan Shih-kai.
^fn7 In 1917 Dr. Sun Yat-sen went from Shanghai to Canton at the head of a naval force which was under his influence. 
Using Kwangtung as a base and co-operating with the Southwestern warlords who were opposed to the Northern warlord Tuan Chi-jui, he set up a military government opposed to Tuan Chi-jui.
^fn8 In 1921 Dr. Sun Yat-sen planned a northern expedition from Kweilin, Kwangsi Province. 
But his plan was frustrated by the mutiny of his subordinate, Chen Chiung ming, who was in league with the Northern warlords.
^fn9 The Whampoa Military Academy, located at Whampoa near Canton, was established by Dr. Sun Yat-sen in 1924 after the reorganization of the Kuomintang with the help of the Chinese Communist Party and the Soviet Union. 
Before Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the revolution in 1927, the academy was run jointly by the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. 
Comrades Chou En-lai, Yeh Chien-ying, Yun Tai-ying, Hsiao Chu-nu and others held responsible posts in the academy at one time or another. 
Many of the cadets were members of the Communist Party or the Communist Youth League, and they formed the revolutionary core of the academy.
^fn10 Tan Yen-kai was a native of Hunan who had been a Henlin, a member of the highest official scholastic body under the Ching Dynasty. 
He was a careerist who first advocated a constitutional monarchy and then took part in the Revolution of 1911. 
His later adherence to the Kuomintang reflected the contradiction between the Hunan landlords and the Northern warlords.
^fn11 The Progressive Party was organized by Liang Chi-chao and others under the aegis of Yuan Shih-kai during the first years of the Republic.
^fn12 Yuan Shih-kai was the head of the Northern warlords in the last years of the Ching Dynasty. 
After the Ching Dynasty was overthrown by the Revolution of 1911, he usurped the presidency of the Republic and organized the first government of the Northern warlords, which represented the big landlord and big comprador classes. 
He did this by relying on counter-revolutionary armed force and on the support of the imperialists and by taking advantage of the conciliationist character of the bourgeoisie, which was then leading the revolution. 
In 1915 he wanted to make himself emperor and, to gain the support of the Japanese imperialists, accepted the Twenty-one Demands with which Japan aimed at obtaining exclusive control of all China. 
In December of the same year an uprising against his assumption of the throne took place in Yunnan Province and promptly won nation-wide response and support. 
Yuan Shih-kai died in Peking in June 1916.
^fn13 Tuan Chi-jui was an old subordinate of Yuan Shih-kai and head of the Anhwei clique of Northern warlords. 
After Yuan's death he more than once controlled the Peking government.
^fn14 The extremely right-wing Political Science Group was formed in 1916 by a section of the Progressive Party and a section of the Kuomintang. 
It gambled now on the Southern, now on the Northern, warlords in order to grab government posts. 
During the Northern Expedition of 1926-27, its pro-Japanese members, such as Huang Fu, Chang Chun and Yang Yung-tai, began to collaborate with Chiang Kai-shek and, using their reactionary political experience, helped him build up a counter revolutionary regime.
^fn15 The Youth Party, also called the Chinese Youth Party or the Etatiste Party, was formed by a handful of unscrupulous fascist politicians. 
They made counter-revolutionary careers for themselves by opposing the Communist Party and the Soviet Union and received subsidies from the various groups of reactionaries in power and from the imperialists.
^fn16 Comrade Mao Tse-tung is here referring mainly to the independent regiment commanded by General Yeh Ting, a Communist, during the Northern Expedition. 
See "The Struggle in the Chingkang Mountains", Note 14 , Eng. ed., PLP, Peking, 1965, Vol. I, p. 104.
^fn17 Nanchang, capital of Kiangsi Province, was the scene of the famous uprising on August 1, 1927 led by the Communist Party of China in order to combat the counterrevolution of Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Ching-wei and to continue the revolution of 1924-27. 
More than thirty thousand troops took part in the uprising which was led by Comrades Chou En-lai, Chu Teh, Ho Lung and Yeh Ting. 
The insurrectionary army withdrew from Nanchang on August I as planned, but suffered a defeat when approaching Chaochow and Swatow in Kwangtung Province. 
Led by Comrades Chu Teh and Chen Yi, part of the troops later fought their way to the Chingkang Mountains and joined forces with the First Division of the First Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Army under Comrade Mao Tse-tung.
^fn18 The famous Autumn Harvest Uprising under the leadership of Comrade Mao Tse-tung was launched in September 1927 by the people's armed forces of Hsiushui Pinghsiang, Pingkiang and Liuyang Counties on the Hunan-Kiangsi border, who formed the First Division of the First Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Army. 
Comrade Mao Tse-tung led this force to the Chingkang Mountains where a revolutionary base was established.
^fn19 Han Fu-chu was a Kuomintang warlord in Shantung Province. 
Liu Chih another warlord, who commanded Chiang Kai-shek's personal troops in Honan Province, was responsible for the defence of the Paoting area in Hopei after the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan. 
Both of them fled before the Japanese without firing a shot.
^c31
^fn1 The Sino-Japanese War of 1894 was started by Japanese imperialism for the purpose of invading Korea and China. 
Many Chinese soldiers and some patriotic generals put up a heroic fight. 
But China suffered defeat because of the corruption of the Ching government and its failure to prepare resistance. 
In 1895 the Ching government concluded the shameful Treaty of Shimonoseki with Japan.
^fn2 For the Reform Movement of 1898 see "On Protracted War", Note 8, p. 191 of this volume.
^fn3 The Yi Ho Tuan Movement was the anti-imperialist armed struggle which took place in northern China in 1900. 
The broad masses of peasants, handicraftsmen and other people took part in this movement. 
Getting in touch with one another through religious and other channels, they organized themselves on the basis of secret societies and waged a heroic struggle against the joint forces of aggression of the eight imperialist powers--the United States, Britain, Japan, Germany, Russia, France, Italy and Austria. 
The movement was put down with indescribable savagery after the joint forces of aggression occupied Tientsin and Peking.
^c32
^fn1 May 4 was first adopted as China's Youth Day by the youth organization of the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region. 
Under the pressure of the patriotic upsurge of the broad masses of young people, the Kuomintang government expressed its agreement. 
But it subsequently proclaimed March 29 as its own Youth Day (in Commemoration of the revolutionary martyrs who died during an uprising at Canton in 1911) because, fearing that the youth would turn revolutionary, it regarded the decision to observe May 4 as dangerous. 
However, May 4 continued to be observed as Youth Day in the revolutionary base areas under the leadership of the Communist Party, and was officially proclaimed China's Youth Day by the Administrative Council of the Central People's Government in December 1949 after the founding of the People's Republic of China.
^fn2 "The Kuomintang turned against the Communist Party" here refers to the counter-revolutionary coups staged in 1927 by Chiang Kai-shek in Shanghai and Nanking and by Wang Ching-wei in Wuhan.
^c33
^fn1 "The international capitulationists" were the British and USA imperialists who were plotting to compromise with Japan by sacrificing China.
^fn2 The projected Pacific international conference was dubbed a Far Eastern Munich because the British, USA and French imperialists, in collaboration with the Chinese group which favoured making peace, were plotting to reach a compromise with Japan by selling out China. 
It was Chiang Kai-shek who used the absurd argument, which Comrade Mao Tse-tung refutes in this article, that such a conference would not constitute an Eastern Munich.
^fn3 In September 1938, the heads of the British, French, German and Italian governments met in Munich, Germany, and concluded the Munich Agreement under which Britain and France betrayed Czechoslovakia to Germany in exchange for a German attack on the Soviet Union. 
In 1938 and 1939, British and USA imperialism made several moves to reach a compromise with Japanese imperialism by sacrificing China. 
At the time when Comrade Mao Tse-tung wrote this article in June 1939, talks were being held between Britain and Japan in another attempt to carry out this scheme. 
It was called an "Eastern Munich" because of its similarity to the Munich conspiracy of Britain, France, Germany and Italy.
^fn4 The duet was being acted by Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Ching-wei. 
While Wang Ching-wei was the ringleader of the open capitulationists, Chiang was the ringleader of those hiding in the anti-Japanese front.
^fn5 At the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang's Fifth Central Executive Committee in January 1939, Chiang Kai-shek openly declared that what he meant by "to the very end" in the slogan "Carry the War of Resistance through to the very end" was merely "to restore the status quo before the Lukouchiao Incident", an interpretation that would have meant abandoning vast areas of northern and northeastern China to Japanese occupation. 
Therefore, to counter Chiang Kai-shek's capitulationist policy, Comrade Mao Tse-tung specially stressed that "to the very end" meant "to fight all the way to the Yalu River and recover all our lost territories".
^fn6 The term "friction" was widely used at the time to refer to the various kinds of reactionary political and military actions of the Kuomintang reactionaries undertaken to wreck the Anti-Japanese National United Front and to oppose the Communist Party and the progressive forces, such as massacres and large-scale attacks on the Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies.
^fn7 Subsequent to the Japanese occupation of Nanking on December 13, 1937, the Japanese government issued a statement on January 16, 1938, saying that Japan would "not accept the National Government as the opposite party in negotiations, and expects a new government to be established". 
After Japanese troops occupied Canton and Wuhan in October 1938, the Japanese government, taking advantage of Chiang Kai-shek's vacillation, changed its policy in order to induce him to capitulate. 
It issued another statement on November 3, which read in part: "As for the National Government, provided it abandons its hitherto erroneous policy and gets new men to carry out rehabilitation and to maintain peace and order, the Empire will not decline to negotiate with it."
^c34
^fn1 These reactionaries were Chiang Kai-shek and his henchmen. 
On June 12, 1939, acting on a secret order from Chiang Kai-shek, the Kuomintang's 27th Group Army dispatched troops to surround the New Fourth Army Liaison Office at Pingkiang, Hunan Province, and in cold blood murdered Comrade Tu Cheng-kun, staff officer of the New Fourth Army, Comrade Lo Tzu-ming, major and adjutant of the Eighth Route Army, and four other comrades. 
This massacre aroused indignation not only among the people in the anti-Japanese democratic base areas but also among honest people in the Kuomintang areas.
^fn2 Comrade Mao Tse-tung defined unification in order to counter the Kuomintang reactionaries' use of "unification" as a pretext for their schemes to liquidate the Communist-led anti-Japanese armed forces and base areas. 
After the renewed Kuomintang-Communist co-operation for joint resistance to Japan, the slogan of "unification" became the Kuomintang's chief weapon in attacking the Communist Party, which it accused of always seeking to be different and of obstructing unification and damaging the cause of resistance. 
This reactionary clamour increased after January 1939, when the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang's Fifth Central Executive Committee adopted the "Measures for Restricting the Activities of Alien Parties" on the proposal of Chiang Kai-shek. 
Comrade Mao Tse-tung wrested the slogan of "unification" from the Kuomintang reactionaries and turned it into a revolutionary slogan for opposing the Kuomintang's divisive activities against the people and the nation.
^fn3 After the fall of Wuhan in October 1938, Japan's main policy became one of employing political means to lure the Kuomintang into capitulation. 
International imperialism, including the British and USA imperialists, also repeatedly suggested to Chiang Kai-shek that he should negotiate peace, and Chamberlain, the British Prime Minister, indicated that Britain would take part in the so-called "reconstruction of the Far East". 
The Japanese aggressors and the international imperialists stepped up their conspiracies in 1939. 
In April of that year, Clark-Kerr, the British ambassador to China, acted as an intermediary between Chiang Kai-shek and the Japanese aggressors in arranging a peace parley. 
In July an agreement was reached between Britain and Japan under which the British government was prepared to recognize the "actual situation" Japan had brought about in China.
^fn4 The "Measures for Restricting the Activities of Alien Parties" were secretly issued by the central authorities of the Kuomintang in 1939. 
They imposed severe restrictions on communist and all other progressive ideas, speech and action, with the aim of disrupting all the anti-Japanese organizations of the people. 
They also stipulated that in places where, in the opinion of the Kuomintang, "the Communists were most active", the "law of collective responsibility and collective punishment" was to be enforced and an "information network", or counter-revolutionary secret service, was to be generally established within the pao-chia organizations. 
Pao and chia were then the basic administrative units of the Kuomintang's fascist regime. 
Ten households formed a chia and ten chia a pao.
^c35
^fn1 The Treaty of Non-Aggression Between the Soviet Union and Germany was signed on August 23, 1939.
^fn2 Aided and abetted by the "non-intervention" policy of the British and French governments, fascist Germany and Italy committed a series of acts of aggression and achieved their purpose. 
Italy began her armed aggression against Abyssinia in October 1935 and occupied the whole country in May 1936. 
In July 1936 Germany and Italy started their joint armed intervention in the internal affairs of Spain and supported the fascist Franco in his rebellion against the Popular Front Government. 
After a prolonged war with the German and Italian interventionists and Franco's rebel troops, the Popular Front Government was defeated in March 1939. 
German troops occupied Austria in March 1938 and invaded the Sudeten area of Czechoslovakia in October. 
In March 1939 the whole of Czechoslovakia came under German occupation.
^fn3 The Agreement Against the Communist International was concluded between Japan and Germany in November 1936; Italy joined it in November 1937.
^fn4 "Using Chinese to subdue Chinese" was a sinister device of the Japanese imperialists in their aggression against China. 
To create divisions within the country, they cultivated various Chinese elements to serve as their stooges. 
After the outbreak of the war, they not only employed the openly pro-Japanese clique within the Kuomintang headed by Wang Ching-wei but also made use of Chiang Kai-shek's clique, in order to check the Communist Party which was the most resolute in resisting Japan. 
In 1939, they ceased attacking Chiang Kai-shek's troops and gave him political encouragement in his anti-Communist activities.
^fn5 "Sustaining the war by means of war" refers to Japan's policy of ruthless plunder of the Chinese areas under her occupation to meet the expenses of her aggressive war.
^fn6 "Mopping-up" campaigns were the Japanese aggressors' euphemism for their barbarous policy of triple atrocity--burning all, killing all and looting all.
^c36
^fn1 The Central News Agency was the official Kuomintang news agency, the Sao Tang Pao was a paper run by military circles in the Kuomintang government and the Hsin Min Pao was one of the mouthpieces of the national bourgeoisie.
^fn2 See Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Programme of National Reconstruction. 
For a long time, the Kuomintang reactionary clique headed by Chiang Kai-shek sought to justify their ruthless counter-revolutionary dictatorship by representing it as either the stage of "military rule" or that of "political tutelage" as envisaged by Dr. Sun.
^fn3 This statement was made by Dr. Sun Yat-sen on November 10, 1924, two days before he left Canton for Peking at the invitation of Feng Yu-hsiang. 
In this statement, which won the support of the whole nation, Dr. Sun reiterated his opposition to imperialism and the warlords and urged that a national assembly be called to settle the problems facing the country. 
Feng Yu-hsiang originally belonged to the Chihli warlord clique, but in the winter of 1924, when war broke out for the second time between them and the Fengtien warlord clique, he refused to fight and led his troops back to Peking, thus causing the downfall of Wu Pei-fu, the actual leader of the Chihli warlords. 
It was then that he sent the telegram inviting Dr. Sun to Pelting.
^c37
^fn1 The League of Nations was an organization formed by Britain, France, Japan and other imperialist powers after World War I for the re-division of the world through bargaining and temporary adjustments of conflicting interests. 
In 1931 the Japanese imperialists occupied China's Northeast and in 1933 Japan withdrew from the League of Nations in order to be able to extend her aggression more freely. 
In the same year the German fascists came to power, and later they, too, withdrew from the League of Nations to facilitate their preparations for a war of aggression. 
It was in 1934, when the threat of a fascist war of aggression was growing, that the Soviet Union joined the League of Nations; in this way the possibility arose of this imperialist organization for the re-division of the world being turned into one that might serve the cause of world peace. 
Italy withdrew from the League of Nations after her invasion of Abyssinia in 1935.
^fn2 The Treaty of Mutual Assistance Between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and France and the Treaty of Mutual Assistance Between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Czechoslovak Republic were concluded in 1935.
^fn3 The British bourgeois politician Lloyd George, who had been Prime Minister during World War I, declared in Parliament in November 1938 when Britain, France, Germany and Italy were going to negotiate, that peace could not be won by rejecting Soviet participation in the negotiations.
^fn4 On September 1, 1939, the Germans invaded Poland and occupied most of her territory. 
On the 17th the reactionary Polish government fled abroad. 
On the same day, the Soviet Union dispatched its troops to eastern Poland in order to recover its own lost territories, emancipate the oppressed Ukrainian and Byelorussian peoples and check the eastward drive of the German fascist troops.
^fn5 The Nomonhan truce agreement was concluded in Moscow in September 1939. 
In May 1939 the Japanese and the puppet "Manchukuo" troops had jointly attacked the troops of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of Mongolia at Nomonhan, on the border between Mongolia and "Manchukuo", and were completely defeated by the Soviet and Mongolian forces in a heroic war of self-defence. 
The Japanese then sued for peace. 
The truce agreement provided for an immediate cease-fire and the formation of a commission of four, with two representatives from each side, to demarcate the frontier between the Mongolian People's Republic and the puppet state of "Manchukuo" at places where the conflict had taken place.
^fn6 The Changkufeng truce agreement was concluded in Moscow on August 11, 1938. 
At the end of July and the beginning of August 1938, the Japanese had committed acts of provocation against the Soviet troops in the Changkufeng district on the border between China, Korea and the Soviet Union and had been vigorously repulsed. 
The Japanese sued for peace. 
The truce agreement provided for an immediate cease-fire and the formation of a commission of four, with two representatives from the Soviet side and two from the Japanese-Manchukuo" side, to investigate the boundary lines and make a final settlement.

^fn2 In saying that in general, armed struggle in the Chinese revolution means guerrilla warfare, Comrade Mao Tse-tung is summing up China's experience of revolutionary war from the Second Revolutionary Civil War to the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan. 
During the long period of the Second Revolutionary Civil War, all the armed struggles led by the Chinese Communist Party took the form of guerrilla warfare. 
In the latter phase of that period, as the strength of the Red Army grew, guerrilla warfare changed into mobile warfare of a guerrilla character which, as Comrade Mao Tse-tung defines it, is guerrilla warfare on a higher level. 
But in the War of Resistance Against Japan, with a different enemy and in different circumstances, there was a shift back to guerrilla warfare. 
In the early days of the anti-Japanese war, those Party comrades who committed the error of Right opportunism belittled the guerrilla warfare led by the Party and pinned their hopes on the operations of the Kuomintang army. 
Comrade Mao Tse-tung refuted their views in his "Problems of Strategy in Guerrilla War Against Japan", "On Protracted War" and "Problems of War and Strategy", and in the present article he gave a theoretical summing-up of the experience gained in waging the prolonged armed struggle of the Chinese revolution which took the form of guerrilla warfare. 
In the latter stage of the anti-Japanese war, and more particularly in the period of the Third Revolutionary Civil War (1945--49), guerrilla warfare changed into regular warfare as the main form of armed struggle under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and this was due to the further growth of the revolutionary forces and the changes in the enemy's circumstances. 
The latter stage of the Third Revolutionary Civil war witnessed a further development, when operations were conducted by huge formations, which, equipped with heavy arms, were able to storm strongly fortified enemy positions.

^fn1 The term "intellectuals" refers to all those who have had middle school or higher education and those with similar educational levels. 
They include university and middle school teachers and staff members, university and middle school students, primary school teachers, professionals, engineers and technicians, among whom the university and middle school students occupy an important position.

^fn1 With reference to the invention of the compass, the magnetic power of the loadstone was mentioned as early as the 3rd century BC by Lu Pu-wei in his Almanac, and at the beginning of the 1st century AD, Wang Chung, the materialist philosopher, observed in his Lun Heng that the loadstone points to the south, which indicates that magnetic polarity was known by then. 
Works of travel written at the beginning of the 12th century show that the compass was already in general use among Chinese navigators at that time.
^fn2 It is recorded in ancient documents that Tsai Lun, a eunuch of the Eastern Han Dynasty (AD 25-220), invented paper, which he had made from bark, hemp, rags and worn-out fishing nets. 
In AD 105 (the last year of the reign of Emperor Ho Ti), Tsai Lun presented his invention to the emperor, and subsequently this method of making paper from plant fibre gradually spread in China.
^fn3 Block-printing was invented about AD 600, in the Sui Dynasty.
^fn4 Movable type was invented by Pi Sheng in the Sung Dynasty between 1041 and 1048.
^fn5 According to tradition, gunpowder was invented in China in the 9th century and by the 11th century it was already in use for firing cannon.
^fn6 Chen Sheng, Wu Kuang, Hsian Yu and Liu Pang were leaders of the first great peasant uprising in the Chin Dynasty. 
In 209 BC Chen Sheng and Wu Kuang, who were among nine hundred conscripts on their way to take up garrison duty at a frontier post, organized a revolt in Chihsien County (now Suhsien County in Anhwei Province) against the tyranny of the Chin Dynasty. 
Hsiang Yu and Liu Pang were the most prominent of those who rose in response to this armed uprising all over the country. 
Hsiang Yu's army annihilated the main forces of Chin, and Liu Pang's troops took Chin's capital. 
In the ensuing struggle between Liu Pang and Hsiang Yu, Liu Pang defeated Hsiang Yu and founded the Han Dynasty.
^fn7 The Hsinshih, the Pinglin, the Red Eyebrows and the Bronze Horses are the names of peasant uprisings in the latter years of the Western Han Dynasty when peasant unrest was widespread. 
In AD 8, Wang Mang overthrew the reigning dynasty, ascended the throne and introduced a few reforms to stave off the peasant unrest. 
But the starving masses in Hsinshih (in what is now Chingshan County in Hupeh) and Pinglin (in what is now Suihsien County in Hupeh) rose in revolt. 
The Bronze Horses and the Red Eyebrows were the peasant forces which revolted during his reign in what are now central Hopei and central Shantung Provinces. 
The Red Eyebrows, the largest of the peasant forces, were so named because the soldiers painted their eyebrows red.
^fn8 The Yellow Turbans, a peasant force which revolted in AD 184, were named after their headgear.
^fn9 Li Mi and Tou Chien-teh were leaders of great peasant uprisings against the Sui Dynasty in Honan and Hopei respectively at the opening of the 7th century.
^fn10 Wang Hsien-chih organized an uprising in Shantung in AD 874. 
In the following year Huang Chao organized an uprising to support him.
^fn11 Sung Chiang and Fang La were famous leaders of peasant uprisings early in the 12th century; Sung Chiang was active along the borders between Shantung, Hopei, Honan and Kiangsu, while Fang La was active in Chekiang and Anhwei.
^fn12 In 1351, the people in many parts of the country rose in revolt against the rule of the Yuan (Mongol) Dynasty. 
In 1352, Chu Yuan-chang joined the rebel forces led by Kuo Tzu-hsing and became their commander upon the latter's death. 
In 1368, he finally succeeded in overthrowing the rule of the Mongol Dynasty, which had been tottering under the attacks of the people's forces, and founded the Ming Dynasty.
^fn13 Li Tzu-cheng, also called King Chuang (the Dare-All King), native of Michih, northern Shensi, was the leader of a peasant revolt which led to the overthrow of the Ming Dynasty. 
The revolt first started in northern Shensi in 1628. 
Li joined the forces led by Kao Ying-hsiang and campaigned through Honan and Anhwei and back to Shensi. 
After Kao's death in 1636, Li succeeded him, becoming King Chuang, and campaigned in and out of the provinces of Shensi, Szechuan, Honan and Hupeh. 
Finally he captured the imperial capital of Peking in 1644, whereupon the last Ming emperor committed suicide. 
The chief slogan he spread among the masses was "Support King Chuang, and pay no grain taxes". 
Another slogan of his to enforce discipline among his men ran: "Any murder means the killing of my father, any rape means the violation of my mother." Thus he won the support of the masses and his movement became the main current of the peasant revolts raging all over the country. 
As he, too, roamed about without ever establishing relatively consolidated base areas, he was eventually defeated by Wu San-kuei, a Ming general, who colluded with the Ching troops in a joint attack on Li.
^fn14 From 1856 to 1860 Britain and France jointly waged a war of aggression against China, with the United States and tsarist Russia supporting them from the side-lines. 
The government of the Ching Dynasty was then devoting all its energies to suppressing the peasant revolution of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and adopted a policy of passive resistance towards the foreign aggressors. 
The Anglo-French forces occupied such major cities as Canton, Tientsin and Peking, plundered and burned down the Yuan Ming Yuan Palace in Peking and forced the Ching government to conclude the Treaties of Tientsin and Peking. 
Their main provisions included the opening of Tientsin, Newchwang, Tengchow, Taiwan, Tamsui, Chaochow, Chiungchow, Nanking, Chinkiang, Kinkiang and Hankow as treaty ports, and the granting to foreigners of special privileges for travel, missionary activities and inland navigation in China's interior. 
From then on, the foreign forces of aggression spread through all China's coastal provinces and penetrated deep into the hinterland.
^fn15 In 1882-83, the French aggressors invaded the northern part of Indo-China. 
In 1884-85 they extended their war of aggression to the Chinese provinces of Kwangsi, Taiwan, Fukien and Chekiang. 
Despite the victories gained in this war, the corrupt Ching government signed the humiliating Treaty of Tientsin.
^fn16 In 1900 eight imperialist powers, Britain, the United States, Germany, France, tsarist Russia, Japan, Italy and Austria, sent a joint force to attack China in their attempt to suppress the Yi Ho Tuan Movement of the Chinese people against aggression. 
The Chinese people resisted heroically. 
The allied forces of the eight powers captured Taku and occupied Tientsin and Peking. 
In 1901 the Ching government concluded a treaty with the eight imperialist countries; its main provisions were that China had to pay those countries the huge sum of 450 million taels of silver as war reparations and grant them the special privilege of stationing troops in Peking and in the area from Peking to Tientsin and Shanhaikuan.
^fn17 Consular jurisdiction was one of the special privileges provided in the unequal treaties which the imperialist powers forced on the governments of old China-- beginning with the supplementary treaty to the Sino-British Treaty of Nanking, signed at Humen (the Bogue) in 1843, and with the Sino-American Treaty of Wanghia in 1844. 
It meant that, if a national of any country enjoying the privilege of consular jurisdiction in China became a defendant in a lawsuit, civil or criminal, he was not to be tried by a Chinese court but by the consul of his own country.
^fn18 Spheres of influence were different parts of China marked off at the end of the 19th century by the imperialist powers that committed aggression against China. 
Each of these powers marked off those areas which fell within its economic and military influence. 
Thus, the provinces in the lower and middle Yangtse valley were specified as the British sphere of influence; Yunnan, Kwangtung and Kwangsi as the French; Shantung as the German sphere; Fukien as the Japanese, and the three northeastern provinces (the present provinces of Liaoning, Kirin and Heilungkiang) as the tsarist Russian sphere. 
After the Russo-Japanese War of 1905 the southern part of the three northeastern provinces came under Japanese influence.
^fn19 The foreign concessions were areas which the imperialist powers seized in the treaty ports after compelling the Ching government to open these ports. 
In these so-called concessions they enforced an imperialist system of colonial rule entirely independent of Chinese law and administration. 
Through those concessions, the imperialists exercised direct or indirect political and economic control over the Chinese feudal and comprador regime. 
During the revolution of 1924-27 the revolutionary people led by the Chinese Communist Party started a movement to abolish the concessions, and in January 1927 they took over the British concessions in Hankow and Kiukiang. 
However, the imperialists retained various concessions after Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution.

In order to help the Chinese people in their War of Resistance Against Japan, he came to China at the head of a medical team and arrived in Yenan in the spring of 1938. 
Soon after he went to the Shansi-Chahar-Hopei border area. 
Imbued with ardent internationalism and the great communist spirit, he served the army and the people of the Liberated Areas for nearly two years. 
He contracted blood poisoning while operating on wounded soldiers and died in Tanghsien, Hopei, on November 12, 1939

^fn8 These anti-Soviet campaigns were instigated by the Kuomintang government following Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the revolution. 
On December 13, 1927, the Kuomintang murdered the Soviet vice-consul in Canton and on the next day its government in Nanking issued a decree breaking off relations with Russia, withdrawing official recognition from Soviet consuls in the provinces and ordering Soviet commercial establishments to cease activity. 
In August 1929 Chiang Kai-shek, under the instigation of the imperialists, organized acts of provocation in the Northeast against the Soviet Union, which resulted in armed clashes.
^fn9 After World War I the British imperialists instigated their vassal Greece to commit aggression against Turkey, but the Turkish people, with the help of the Soviet Union, defeated the Greek troops in 1922. 
In 1923, Kemal was elected President of Turkey. 
Stalin said:
A Kemalist revolution is a revolution of the top stratum, a revolution of the national merchant bourgeoisie, arising in a struggle against the foreign imperialists, and whose subsequent development is essentially directed against the peasants and workers, against the very possibility of an agrarian revolution.

^fn10 The "metaphysics-mongers" were Chang Chun-mai and his group. 
After the May 4th movement, Chang openly opposed science and advocated metaphysics, or what he called "spiritual culture", and thus came to be known as a "metaphysics-monger". 
In order to support Chiang Kai-shek and the Japanese aggressors, he published an "Open Letter to Mr Mao Tse-tung" in December 1938 at Chiang Kai-shek's bidding, wildly demanding the abolition of the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army and the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region.

^fn17 The "principle of going up into the hills" was a dogmatist gibe against Comrade Mao Tse-tung for his emphasis on rural revolutionary bases. 
He makes use of the expression to explain the importance of the role played by the rural revolutionary bases.
^fn18 The modern school system was the educational system modelled on that of capitalist countries in Europe and America. 
The imperial examination system was the old examination system in feudal China. 
Towards the end of the 19th century, enlightened Chinese intellectuals urged the abolition of the old competitive examination system and the establishment of modern schools.
^fn19 The June 3rd Movement marked a new stage in the patriotic movement of May 4. 
On June 3, 1919, students in Peking held public meetings and made speeches in defiance of persecution and repression by the army and police. 
They went on strike and the strike spread to the workers and merchants in Shanghai, Nanking, Tientsin, Hangchow, Wuhan and Kiukiang and in the provinces of Shantung and Anhwei. 
Thus the May 4th Movement grew into a broad mass movement in which the proletariat, the urban petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie all participated.

(2) From its central government down to the local governments, the puppet regime was to be under the supervision of Japanese advisors and officials.
(3) The puppet troops and police were to be trained by Japanese military instructors and their equipment was to be supplied by Japan.
(4) The puppet government's fiscal and economic policies, its industrial and agricultural enterprises and its means of communication were to be controlled by Japan, and China's natural resources were to be freely exploited by Japan,
(5) All anti-Japanese activities were to be prohibited.

^fn1 For the Pingkiang massacre, see "The Reactionaries Must Be Punished", Note 1, p. 260 of this volume.
^fn2 The Chuehshan massacre occurred on November 11, 1939, when more than 1,800 Kuomintang secret agents and soldiers attacked the liaison offices of the New Fourth Army in the town of Chukou, Chuchshan County, Honan. 
Over two hundred people were murdered, including New Fourth Army officers and soldiers who had been Wounded in the anti-Japanese war and members of their families.
^fn3 The old army refers to the troops under Yen Hsi-shan, the Kuomintang warlord in Shansi; the new army, known as the Anti-Japanese Dare-to-Die Corps, was the people's anti-Japanese army of Shansi which grew up under the influence and leadership of the Communist Party. 
In December 1939 Chiang Kai-shek and Yen Hsi-shan concentrated six army corps in western Shansi to attack the corps, but met with a smashing defeat. 
At the same time, Yen's troops in southeastern Shansi attacked the anti-Japanese democratic county governments and mass organizations in the Yangcheng-chincheng area and murdered a great number of Communists and progressives.
^fn4 Chang Yin-wu, commander of the peace preservation corps of the Kuomintang brigands in Hopei, sprang a surprise attack on the liaison offices of the Eighth Route Army in Shenhsien County, Hopei, in June 1939 and slaughtered more than four hundred of its cadres and soldiers.
^fn5 In April 1939, on the instructions of Shen Hung-lieh, the Kuomintang governor of Shantung, Chin Chi-jung's bandit troops attacked the Third Guerrilla Detachment of the Shantung Column of the Eighth Route Army at Poshan, killing four hundred men, including regimental officers.
^fn6 In September 1939, Cheng Ju-huai, a Kuomintang military commander in eastern Hupeh, attacked the liaison offices of the New Fourth Army and killed between five and six hundred Communists.
^fn7 From the winter of 1939 to the spring of 1940 the Kuomintang troops seized the county towns of Chunhua, Hsunyi, Chengning, Ninghsien and Chenynan in the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region.
^fn8 Imitating the German and Italian fascists, the Kuomintang reactionaries established during the anti-Japanese war many concentration camps which extended from Lanchow and Sian in the Northwest to Kanchow and Shangjao in the Southeast. 
Large numbers of Communists, patriots and progressive youth were interned in them.
^fn9 After the fall of Wuhan in October 1938, the Kuomintang intensified its anti-Communist activities. 
In February 1939 Chiang Kai-shek secretly issued such documents as "Measures for Dealing with the Communist Problem" and "Measures for Guarding Against Communist Activities in the Japanese-Occupied Areas", and stepped up his political repression of the Communist Party in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and his military attacks on it in central and northern China. 
The culmination was the first large-scale anti-Communist onslaught of December 1939--March 1940.
^fn10 The Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies later engaged an even larger number of Japanese troops. 
By 1943 they were fighting 64 per cent of Japan's forces of aggression and 95 per cent of the puppet troops.
^fn11 Five yuan was the average monthly allowance for all men serving in the anti-Japanese armed forces and in the anti-Japanese government offices under Communist leadership.

^fn1 The League of Self-Sacrifice for National Salvation in Shansi was a local anti-Japanese mass organization formed in 1936 which co-operated closely with the Communist Party. 
It played an important role in the anti-Japanese fighting there. 
In December 1939 Yen Hsi-shan, the Kuomintang warlord-governor of Shansi, openly began to suppress the league in the western part of the province and brutally killed a great number of Communists, officers of the league and other progressives.
^fn2 In 1939 the Kuomintang drew a cordon along the Hsienyang-Yulin Highway and the Lunghai (Kansu-Haichow) Railway by setting up a number of check-posts in the guise of "hostels" of the Three Peoples Principles Youth League. 
Secret agents posted at these hostels, working together with the Kuomintang troops, arrested progressive young people and intellectuals entering or leaving the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region and interned them in concentration camps, where they were either cruelly murdered or compelled to turn informer against the Communist Party.

^fn3 In 1923 Tsao Kun, a big Northern warlord, had himself elected President of the Republic by bribing 590 members of parliament with 5,000 silver dollars each. 
He then promulgated a constitution, which came to be known as the "Tsao Kun Constitution" or the "Constitution of Bribery".
^fn4 Li Yuan-hung was originally commander of a brigade in the armed forces of the Ching Dynasty. 
He was compelled by his officers and men to side with the revolution during the Wuchang Uprising in 1911 and was made military governor of Hupeh Province. 
He later became Vice-President and then President of the Republic under the regime of the Northern warlord clique.
^fn5 Feng Kuo-chang was one of Yuan Shih-kai's underlings. 
After Yuan's death, he became the leader of the Chihli (Hopei) group of the Northern warlord clique. 
In 1917 he got rid of Li Yuan-hung and became President himself.
^fn6 Hsu Shih-chang was a politician in the service of the Northern warlord clique. 
He was elected President in 1918 by the parliament controlled by Tuan Chi-jui.
^fn7 The People's Political Council was a mere advisory body reluctantly set up by the Kuomintang government after the outbreak of the anti-Japanese war. 
The members were all "invited" by the Kuomintang government. 
Nominally it included the representatives of all anti-Japanese political parties and groups, but it was actually dominated by the Kuomintang majority. 
It had no power to influence the policies or the measures adopted by the Kuomintang government. 
As Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang became more and more reactionary, the number of Kuomintang and other reactionaries on the council increased while the number of democrats decreased and their freedom of speech was severely curtailed, until the council increasingly became a mere tool of Kuomintang reaction. 
After the Southern Anhwei Incident of 1941, the Communist members of the council boycotted its meetings several times in protest against the Kuomintang's reactionary measures.
^fn8 A resolution demanding that the Kuomintang government convene a national assembly and establish a constitutional government at a fixed date was passed at the Fourth Session of the People's Political Council in September 1939, on the proposal of the Communist Party and the democrats of other parties and groups. 
In November 1939 the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang announced that the national assembly would be convened on November 12, 1940. 
Though much publicized to dupe the people, this pledge came to nothing.
^fn9 Yuan Shih-kai proclaimed himself emperor on December 12, 1915, but was forced to give up the title on March 22, 1916.

^fn4 The units of the New Fourth Army under Yeh Fei and Chang Yun-yi were then carrying on anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare and building up an anti-Japanese base area north of the Yangtse River in central Kiangsu and eastern Anhwei.
^fn5 During March and April 1940, Li Pin-hsien, the Kuomintang provincial governor of Anhwei, and Li Tsung-jen, the Kuomintang commander of the 5th War Zone, both warlords of the Kwangsi clique, launched large-scale offensives on the New Fourth Army in the Anhwei-Hupeh border area. 
Comrade Chang Yun-yi commander of New Fourth Army units north of the Yangtse River, and Comrade Li Hsien-nien, commander of the Army's Hupeh-Honan Assault Troops, lodged strong protests and repulsed the offensives.
^fn6 The mistake of 1927 refers to Chen Tu-hsiu's Right opportunism.
^fn7 In January 1940 the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party dispatched more than 20,000 men of the Eighth Route Army from northern China to reinforce the New Fourth Army in its anti-Japanese warfare north of the Huai River and in eastern Anhwei and northern Kiangsu.
^fn8 Pao chia was the administrative system by which the Kuomintang reactionary clique enforced its fascist rule at the primary level.
^fn9 Chiang Kai-shek's clique called its own armed forces the Central Army and those belonging to other cliques troops of miscellaneous brands. 
It discriminated against the latter and did not treat them on an equal footing with the Central Army.

^fn1 Wang Yi-tang was a big bureaucrat in the period of the Northern warlords and a pro-Japanese traitor. 
He was recalled from retirement by Chiang Kai-shek after the Northern China Incident of 1935 to serve in the Kuomintang government. 
In 1938, he served as a Japanese puppet in northern China and was made chairman of the bogus Northern China Political Council.
^fn2 Shih Yu-san was a Kuomintang warlord who frequently changed sides. 
He was commander-in-chief of the Kuomintang's 10th Army Group after the outbreak of the War of Resistance, collaborated with the Japanese armed forces in southern Hopei and did nothing but attack the Eighth Route Army, destroy organs of anti-Japanese democratic political power and slaughter Communists and progressives.

^fn2 The counter-revolutionary Order of January 17 for the disbandment of the New Fourth Army was issued by Chiang Kai-shek in the name of the Military Council of the National Government.
^fn3 These two notorious telegrams were sent late in 1940 by Chiang Kai-shek when he launched the second anti-Communist onslaught, and they were signed by Ho Ying-chin and Pai Chung-hsi, Chief and Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Military Council of the Kuomintang government. 
The telegram of October 19 contained outrageous calumnies against the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army which were fighting in the enemy-occupied areas and peremptorily ordered their units operating against the Japanese south of the Yellow River to be shifted to the north by a specified date. 
In the interest of unity for armed resistance, Comrades Chu Teh, Peng Teh-huai, Yeh Ting and Hsiang Ying, in a joint reply on November 9 consented to shift the troops in southern Anhwei to the north, at the same time rebutting the slanders. 
The telegram of December 8 signed by Ho Ying-chin and Pai Chung-hsi, which was a reply to the telegram of November 9, represented a further attempt to turn public opinion against the Communists.
^fn4 The blockade line in the Northwest was built by the Kuomintang reactionaries around the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region. 
From 1939 onward they pressed the local people into service and built five lines of blockhouses, stone walls and trenches. 
The line started from Ningsia in the west, ran along the Chingshui River in the south and terminated at the Yellow River in the east. 
On the eve of the Southern Anhwei Incident the Kuomintang troops surrounding the Border Region were increased to more than 200,000.
^fn5 The quotation is from Confucian Analects, Book XVI, Chapter I.

^fn2 On March 6, 1941, Chiang Kai-shek delivered an anti-Communist speech at a meeting of the People's Political Council. 
Harping on his old theme that the "direction of all military and political affairs" must be "unified", he declared that the organs of anti-Japanese democratic political power in the enemy's rear should be abolished and that the people's armed forces led by the Chinese Communist Party must be "concentrated in specified areas" according to his "orders and plans". 
On the same day, the People's Political Council, which was dominated by the Kuomintang reactionaries, passed a resolution whitewashing Chiang Kai-shek's anti-Communist and anti-popular activities and violently attacking the Communist members of the People's Political Council for their refusal to attend the council's session in protest against the Southern Anhwei Incident.

^fn4 The first set of "twelve demands", proposed by the Communist members of the People's Political Council at its session of February 15, 1941, were similar to those listed in the "Order and Statement on the Southern Anhwei Incident". 
The second set were put to Chiang Kai-shek on March 2, 1941 by the Communist members of the People's Political Council as a condition for their attendance of the council's sessions and were as follows:
(1) Immediately stop the anti-Communist military attacks all over the country.
(2) Immediately stop the nation-wide political persecution of the Chinese Communist Party and of all other democratic parties and groups, recognize their legal status, and release all their members arrested in Sian, Chungking Kweiyang and other places.
(3) Lift the ban on the bookshops which have been closed down in various places, and rescind the order for impounding anti-Japanese books and newspapers in post offices.
(4) Immediately stop all restrictions on the New China Daily.
(5) Recognize the legal status of the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region.
(6) Recognize the organs of anti-Japanese democratic political power in the enemy's rear.
(7) Maintain the status quo in the division of garrison areas in central northern and northwestern China.
(8) Let the Communist-led armed forces form another group army in addition to the Eighteenth Group Army, making a total of six army corps.
(9) Release all the cadres arrested during the Southern Anhwei Incident and provide funds for the relief of the victims' families.
(10) Release all officers and men taken prisoner during the Southern Anhwei Incident and return all their arms.
(11) Form a joint committee of all the parties and groups, with one representative from each, and appoint the Kuomintang and the Communist Party representatives to be its chairman and vice-chairman respectively.
(12) Include Communist representatives in the presidium of the People's Political Council.

^fn1 The neutrality pact between the Soviet Union and Japan, concluded on April , 1941, ensured peace on the eastern border of the Soviet Union, thus crushing the plot for a joint German, Italian and Japanese attack on the Soviet Union. 
It marked a major victory for the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy.
^fn2 The April 12th Incident was the counter-revolutionary coup d'etat staged by Chiang Kai-shek in Shanghai on April 12, 1927, during which a great number of Communists and revolutionary workers, peasants and students and intellectuals were massacred.
^fn3 Instigated by Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Ching-wei, the counter-revolutionary Kuomintang army commanders in Hunan, including Hsu Keh-hsiang and Ho Chien, ordered a raid on the provincial headquarters of the trade unions, the peasant associations and other revolutionary organizations in Changsha on May 21, 1927, Communists and revolutionary workers and peasants were arrested and killed en masse. 
This signalized the open collaboration of the two counter-revolutionary Kuomintang cliques, the Wuhan clique headed by Wang Ching-wei and the Nanking clique headed by Chiang Kai-shek.
^fn4 The first anti-Communist onslaught during the anti-Japanese war was conducted by Chiang Kai-shek in the winter of 1939 and the spring of 1940.
^fn5 The quotation is from the commentary by Chu Hsi (1130--1200), a philosopher of the Sung Dynasty, on the Confucian Doctrine of the Mean, Chapter 13.
^fn6 The telegram of November 9, 1940 was sent by Chu Teh and Peng Teh-huai, Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Eighteenth Group Army (Eighth Route Army), and Yeh Ting and Hsiang Ying, Commander and Deputy Commander of the New Fourth Army, in reply to the telegram of the Kuomintang generals Ho Ying-chin and Pai Chung-hsi, dated October 19, 1940. 
Exposing the plot by the Kuomintang reactionaries to attack the Communist Party and capitulate to Japan, they denounced Ho Ying-chin's and Pai Chung-hsi's absurd proposal that the New Fourth Army and the Eighth Route Army should shift from the south to the north of the Yellow River. 
However, in a spirit of conciliation and compromise for the sake of maintaining unity against Japan, they agreed to shift their forces from the south to the north of the Yangtse River, while demanding the solution of a number of major outstanding issues between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. 
The telegram won the sympathy of the intermediate sections and served to isolate Chiang Kai-shek.

^fn4 The first period of the ten years' civil war lasted from late 1927 to late 1928 and is generally known as the Chingkangshan period; the middle period ran from early 1929 to the autumn of 1931, that is, from the establishment of the Central Red Base Area to the victorious conclusion of the campaign against the third "encirclement and suppression"; and the third period from late 1931 to late 1934, that is, from the victorious conclusion of that campaign to the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau at Tsunyi in Kweichow Province called by the Central Committee of the Party. 
The Tsunyi Meeting of January 1935 put an end to the domination of the "Left" opportunist line in the Party, which had lasted from 1931 to 1934, and steered the Party back to the correct line.

^fn1 The Southern Shansi campaign refers to the campaign of the Chungtiao Mountains. 
In May 1941, a Japanese invading force 50,000 strong attacked the Chungtiao Mountains area to the north of the Yellow River in southern Shansi. 
Altogether seven Kuomintang corps were massed in that area, and another four in the Kaoping area to the northeast, making a total of 250,000 men. 
Since the fight against the Communists was the main job of the Kuomintang troops north of the Yellow River, they had never prepared themselves to fight the Japanese, and most of them tried to avoid combat when the Japanese aggressors attacked. 
Therefore, in spite of vigorous efforts by the Eighth Route Army to support the Kuomintang troops against the enemy in this campaign, the Kuomintang troops were completely routed, losing more than 50,000 men in three weeks, while the remainder fled to the south of the Yellow River.

^fn1 Stereotyped writing, or the "eight-legged essay", was the special form of essay prescribed in the imperial examinations under China's feudal dynasties from the 15th to the 19th centuries; it consisted in juggling with words, concentrated only on form and was devoid of content. 
Structurally the main body of the essay had eight parts--presentation, amplification, preliminary exposition, initial argument, inceptive paragraphs, middle paragraphs, rear paragraphs and concluding paragraphs, and the fifth to eighth parts each had to have two "legs", ie, two antithetical paragraphs, hence the name "eight-legged essay". 
The "eight-legged essay" became a byword in China denoting stereotyped formalism and triteness. 
Thus "stereotyped Party writing", characterizes the writings of certain people in the revolutionary ranks who piled up revolutionary phrases and terms higgledy-piggledy instead of analysing the facts. 
Like the "eight-legged essay", their writings were nothing but verbiage.

^fn5 Chang Kuo-tao was a renegade from the Chinese revolution. 
In early life, speculating on the revolution he joined the Chinese Communist Party. 
In the Party he made many mistakes resulting in serious crimes. 
The most notorious of these was his opposition in 1935 to the Red Army's northward march and his defeatism and liquidationism in advocating withdrawal by the Red Army to the minority-nationality areas on the Szechuan-Sikang borders; what is more, he openly carried out traitorous activities against the Party and the Central Committee, established his own bogus central committee, disrupted the unity of the Party and the Red Army, and caused heavy losses to the Fourth Front Army of the Red Army. 
But thanks to patient education by Comrade Mao Tse-tung and the Central Committee, the Fourth Front Army and its numerous cadres soon returned to the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Party and played a glorious role in subsequent struggles. 
Chang Kuo-tao, however, proved incorrigible and in the spring of 1938 he slipped out of the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region and joined the Kuomintang secret police.

^fn2 Opposition to stereotyped writing, whether old or new, runs all through Lu Hsun's works. 
The foreign stereotype was developed after the May 4th Movement by some shallow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois intellectuals and, disseminated by them, existed for a long time among revolutionary cultural workers. 
In a number of essays, Lu Hsun fought against the foreign stereotype as found in their ranks and condemned it in these terms:
A clean sweep should be made of all stereotyped writings, whether old or new…. 
For instance, it is also a kind of stereotype if all one can do is to "hurl insults", "threaten" or even "pass sentence" and merely copy old formulas and apply these indiscriminately to every fact, instead of specifically and concretely using formulas derived from science to interpret the new facts and phenomena which emerge every day.

"It will be a free literature, because the idea of socialism and sympathy with the working people, and not greed or careerism, will bring ever new forces to its ranks. 
It will be a free literature, because it will serve, not some satiated heroine, not the bored "upper ten thousand" suffering from fatty degeneration, but the millions and tens of millions of working people--the flower of the country, its strength and its future.
 It will be a free literature, enriching the last word in the revolutionary thought of mankind with the experience and living work of the socialist proletariat, bringing about permanent interaction between the experience of the past (scientific socialism, the completion of the development of socialism from its primitive, utopian forms) and the experience of the present (the present struggle of the worker comrades).

^fn4 "Teams for the exchange of labour" and "teams for the exchange and hire of labour" were both labour organizations for collective mutual aid in agriculture in the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region. 
Labour-exchange is a means by which the peasants adjust labour power among themselves. 
Man-workdays were exchanged for man-workdays, ox-workdays for ox-workdays, man-workdays for ox-workdays etc. 
Peasants who joined labour-exchange teams contributed their labour power or animal power to cultivate the land of each member-family collectively and in rotation. 
In settling accounts, the workday was taken as the unit of exchange those who contributed more man-workdays or animal-workdays were paid for the difference by those who contributed less. 
"Teams for the exchange and hire of labour" were usually formed by peasants with insufficient land. 
Besides exchanging work among themselves for mutual aid, their members also hired themselves out collectively to families which were short of labour power.
^fn5 Mutual-aid working groups and ploughing teams, based on individual farming, were formed by peasants in the Red areas to facilitate production through a better organization of labour power. 
On the principle of voluntary participation and mutual benefit, the members did an equal amount of work for each other, or if one could not give another as much help as he received he made up the difference in cash. 
Apart from helping each other, the teams gave preferential treatment to the families of Red Army soldiers and worked for bereaved old folk without any pay except for meals during the work. 
As these measures of mutual aid were of great help to production and were carried out on a reasonable basis they won the warm support of the masses.

^fn1 Chen Tu-hsiu was originally a professor at Peking University and became famous as an editor of New Youth. 
He was one of the founders of the Communist Party of China. 
Because of his reputation at the time of the May 4th Movement and owing to the Party's immaturity in its initial period, he became General Secretary of the Party. 
In the last period of the revolution of 1924-27, the Rightist thinking in the Party represented by Chen Tu-hsiu developed into a line of capitulationism. 
Comrade Mao Tse-tung has observed that the capitulationists at that dime "voluntarily gave up the Party's leadership of the peasant masses, urban petty bourgeoisie and middle bourgeoisie, and in particular gave up the Party's leadership of the armed forces, thus causing the defeat of the revolution" ("The Present Situation and Our Tasks", , Eng. ed., FLP, Peking, 1961, Vol. IV, p. 171). 
After the defeat of 1927 Chen Tu-hsiu and a handful of other capitulationists lost faith in the future of the revolution and became liquidationists. 
They took the reactionary Trotskyist stand and together with the Trotskyites formed a small anti-Party group. 
Consequently Chen Tu-hsiu was expelled from the Party in November 1929. 
He died in 1942.

^fn5 The Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of China held in July 1928 adapted the following Ten-Point Programme: (1) overthrow imperialist role; (2) confiscate foreign capitalist enterprises and banks; (3) unify China and recognize the right of the nationalities to self-determination; (4) overthrow the Kuomintang warlord government; (5) establish a government of councils of workers, peasants and soldiers; (6) institute the eight-hour day, increase wages, and establish unemployment relief and social insurance; (7) confiscate the land of all landlords and distribute the land among the peasants, (8) improve the living conditions of the soldiers, give land and jobs to ex-soldiers; (9) abolish all exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies and adopt a consolidated progressive tax; and (10) unite with the world proletariat, unite with the Soviet Union.
^fn6 The Fifth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was held in January 1934.
^fn7 This session of the Political Bureau in September 1941 reviewed the question of the political line in the past history of the Party, especially during the Second Revolutionary Civil War.
^fn8 The "mountain-stronghold" mentality was a tendency to form cliques and arose mainly out of the circumstances of the protracted guerrilla war in which rural revolutionary bases were scattered and cut off from each other. 
Most of these bases were first established in mountain regions. 
Each tended to regard itself as a compact unit, like a single mountain stronghold, so this wrong tendency became known as mountain-stronghold mentality.
^fn9 In the relatively stable parts of the base areas the people paid the regular grain tax only to the anti-Japanese democratic government. 
But in the outlying parts of the base areas and the guerrilla zones, which were constantly harassed by the enemy, the people were often forced to pay another grain levy to the enemy's puppet government.
^fn10 In March 1941 the Japanese invaders and Chinese traitors in northern China proclaimed a "campaign for tightening public security", which included raiding the people's houses, establishing the neighbourhood guarantee system, making house-to-house check-ups and organizing puppet troops, all for the purpose of suppressing the anti-Japanese forces.
^fn11 In March 1944 the Japanese invaders launched their campaign in Honan Province with a force of 50,000 to 60,000 men. 
The 400,000 Kuomintang troops under Chiang Ting-wen, Tang En-po and Hu Tsung-nan melted away before the Japanese invaders. 
Thirty-eight counties, including Chengchow and Loyang, fell to the enemy one after another. 
Tang En-po lost 200,000 men.
^fn12 This large-scale war between the warlords, with Chiang Kai-shek on the one side and Feng Yu-hsiang and Yen Hsi-shan on the other, was fought along the Luaghai and Tientsin-Pukow Railways. 
It lasted six months, from May to October 1930. 
Casualties on both sides reached 300,000.
^fn13 Kuo Mo-jo wrote the essay "The Tercentenary of the 1644 Uprising" in 1944 to commemorate the victory of the peasant uprising led by Li Tzu-cheng in the last years of the Ming Dynasty. 
He explained that the uprising met with defeat in 1645 because, after the entry of the peasant forces into Peking in 1644, some of their leaders were corrupted by luxurious living, and factional strife arose. 
The essay first appeared in New China Daily in Chungking and was later published as a pamphlet in Yenan and elsewhere in the Liberated Areas.

^fn2 The Whampoa Military Academy, located at Whampoa near Canton, was established by Dr. Sun Yat-sen in 1924 after the reorganization of the Kuomintang with the help of the Chinese Communist Party and the Soviet Union. 
Before Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the revolution in 1927, the academy was run jointly by the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. 
Comrades Chou En-lai, Yeh Chien-ying, Yun Tai-yIng, Hsiao Chu-nu and others held responsible posts in the academy at one time or another. 
Many of the cadets were members of the Communist Party or the Communist Youth League, and they formed the revolutionary core of the academy.
^fn3 Pang Ping-hsun, Sun Liang-cheng and Chen Hsiao-chiang were Kuomintang generals who openly deserted to the Japanese invaders.
^fn4 The Dare-to-Die Corps in Shansi was an anti-Japanese armed force of the people which developed under the leadership and influence of the Communist Party in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan.
^fn5 In April 1944 the Kuomintang announced that "a greater latitude will be allowed to the voicing of opinions". 
Its purpose was to fob off the people, because the demand that the Kuomintang dictatorship should be ended, democracy established, and freedom of speech guaranteed had become the general cry of the people in the Kuomintang areas from the beginning of the year. 
In May, the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang again declared that it would "protect freedom of speech". 
But the Kuomintang never fulfilled any of the promises it had been compelled to make, and as the people's movement for democracy surged forward, it multiplied its measures fat the suppression of popular opinion.

^fn1 The Chinese National Liberation Vanguard Corps, or to give its shorter name the National Vanguard Corps, was a revolutionary youth organization formed under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in September 1936 by the progressive youth who participated in the December 9th Movement of 1935. 
After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, many of its members saw action and took part in building base areas behind the enemy lines. 
The organizations of the National Vanguard Corps in the Kuomintang areas were forcibly dissolved by the Chiang Kai-shek government in 1938; those in the Liberated Areas were later merged into the Association of Youth for National Salvation, an organization of even broader scope.
^fn2 On July 7, 1937, the Japanese invading forces attacked the Chinese garrison at Lukouchiao, some ten kilometres southwest of Peking. 
Under the influence of the ardent and nation-wide anti-Japanese movement the Chinese troops put up resistance. 
This incident marked the beginning of the Chinese people's heroic War of Resistance Against Japan which lasted for eight years.
^fn3 For a fuller account of the three anti-Communist onslaughts, see "A Comment on the Sessions of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee and of the People's Political Council", pp. 137-51 of this volume.
^fn4 These operations to force China's north-south trunk railways open for through traffic constituted the offensive launched in May 1944 by the Japanese army to seize the Canton-Hankow Railway along its entire length and thus secure an uninterrupted land link between northern and southern China.
^fn5 Scobie was the commander of the British imperialist forces of aggression in Greece. 
In October 1944, when the German invaders were retreating in defeat on the European continent, Scobie's troops entered the country, bringing with them the reactionary Greek government that had been in exile in London. 
Scobie directed and assisted this government in attacking the Greek People's Liberation Army, which had waged a long and heroic struggle against the German invaders, and in massacring Greek patriots, and so plunged Greece into a blood bath.
^fn6 Pao chia was the administrative system by which the Kuomintang reactionary clique enforced its fascist rule at the primary level. 
On August 1, 1932, Chiang Kai-shek promulgated his "Regulations for the Organization of Pao and Chia and for a Population Census in the Counties", covering the provinces of Honan, Hupeh and Anhwei. 
The "Regulations" provided that "the pao and chia are to be organized on the basis of households; there is to be a head of each household, of each chia, which is made up of ten households, and of each pao, which is made up of ten chia". 
Neighbours were required to watch each other's activities and report them to the authorities, and all were punishable when one was found guilty; counter-revolutionary measures for exacting compulsory labour were also laid down. 
On November 7, 1934, the Kuomintang government officially announced that this system of fascist rule was to be established in all the provinces and municipalities under its rule.
^fn7 The Cairo conference, held by China, the United States and Britain in November 1943, issued the Cairo Declaration which clearly stipulated that Taiwan and certain other territories were to be returned to China. 
In June 1950 the USA government sent a fleet to control Taiwan in open repudiation of this agreement, in the attempt to deprive China of her sovereignty over it.
^fn8 Yuan Shih-kai was the head of the Northern warlords in the last years of the Ching Dynasty. 
After the Ching Dynasty was overthrown by the Revolution of 1911, he usurped the president of the Republic and organized the first government of the Northern warlords, which represented the big landlord and big comprador classes. 
He did this by relying on counter-revolutionary armed force and on the support of the imperialists and by taking advantage of the conciliationist character of the bourgeoisie, which was then leading the revolution. 
In 1915 he wanted to make himself emperor and, to gain the support of the Japanese imperialists, accepted the Twenty-one Demands with which Japan aimed at obtaining exclusive control of all China. 
In December of the same year an uprising against his assumption of the throne took place in Yunnan Province and promptly won nation-wide response and support. 
Yuan Shih-kai died in Peking in June 1916.
^fn9 Omei is a famous mountain in the southwestern part of Szechuan Province. 
Here it symbolizes the mountainous areas of Szechuan, the last refuge of the Chiang Kai-shek ruling clique in the War of Resistance Against Japan.
^fn10 From Dr. Sun Yat-sen's "Statement on My Departure for the North", dated November 10, 1924.
^fn11 For many decades, beginning with the end of the 18th century, Britain exported an increasing quantity of opium to China. 
This traffic not only subjected the Chinese people to drugging but also plundered China of her silver. 
It aroused fierce opposition in China. 
In 1840, under the pretext of safeguarding its trade with China, Britain launched armed aggression against her. 
The Chinese troops led by Lin Tse-hsu put up resistance, and the people in Canton spontaneously organized the "Quell the British Corps", which dealt serious blows to the British forces of aggression. 
In 1842, however, the corrupt Ching regime signed the Treaty of Nanking with Britain. 
This treaty provided for the payment of indemnities and the cession of Hongkong to Britain, and stipulated that Shanghai, Foochow, Amoy, Ningpo and Canton were to be opened to British trade and that tariff rates for British goods imported into China were to be jointly fixed by China and Britain.
^fn12 The Atlantic Charter was issued jointly by the United States and Britain at the conclusion of their Atlantic conference in August 1941. 
The Moscow conference was held in October 1943 by the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain. 
The Teheran conference of the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain was held in the capital of Iran from November to December 1943. 
The Crimea conference of the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain took place in February 1945 at Yalta. 
At all these international conferences the signatories recorded their resolve to defeat fascist Germany and Japan through common endeavour and, after the war, to prevent the revival of the forces of aggression and the remnants of fascism, maintain world peace and help the peoples of all countries to realize their aspirations for independence and democracy. 
But immediately after the war the USA and British governments violated all these international agreements.
^fn13 As the representative of China's Liberated Areas Comrade Tang Pi-wu attended the United Nations Conference on International Organization which was held at San Francisco from April to June 1945, with the participation of representatives from fifty countries. 
The proposals for the Organization of the United Nations were drafted at Dumbarton Oaks, USAA., where the representatives of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain and China met from August to October 1944 in accordance with the decisions of the Moscow and Teheran conferences.
^fn14 With Japan's surrender the situation changed and the people's conference of the Chinese Liberated Areas was not convened, although a Preparatory Committee for this conference was formed in Yenan after the Seventh National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party and held an inaugural meeting which was attended by representative from all the Liberated Areas.

^fn1 Patrick J. Hurley, a reactionary Republican Party politician, was appointed USA ambassador to China towards the end of 1944. 
In November 1945 he was forced to resign because his support for Chiang Kai-shek's anti-Communist policy roused the firm opposition of the Chinese people.
 Harley's open declaration against cooperation with the Chinese Communist Party was made on April 2, 1945 at a USA State Department press conference in Washington. 
For details, see "The Hurley-Chiang Duet Is a Flop", pp. 281-84 of this volume.

^fn1 The radio speech made by Chiang Kai-shek on January 1, 1945 did not even mention the ignominious defeats of the Kuomintang troops at the hands of the Japanese aggressors in the previous year, but maligned the people and opposed the proposal for abolishing the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship and for setting up a coalition government and a joint supreme command, a proposal supported by all the people and all the anti-Japanese parties in the country. 
He insisted on continuing the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship and as a shield against the people's criticism he talked about convening a Kuomintang-controlled "National Assembly" which had been spurned by the whole nation.
^fn2 On March l, 1945 Chiang Kai-shek made a speech in Chungking at the Association for the Establishment of Constitutional Government. 
Besides reiterating the reactionary views of his New Year's Day speech, Chiang proposed the formation of a Committee of Three, including a USA representative, to "reorganize" the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, which amounted to an open invitation to the USA imperialists to intervene in China's domestic affairs.
^fn3 In 1923, the Northern warlord Tsao Kun had himself elected "President of the Republic of China" by giving members of parliament a bribe of 5,000 silver dollars each. 
He became notorious as the president elected through bribery, and the bribed members came to be called "members of the Parliament of Pigs". 
Comrade Mao Tse-tung's analogy here likens the Kuomintang's bogus "National Assembly" to the "Parliament of Pigs".

^fn1 Earl Browder was the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the United States of America from 1930 to 1944.
 During World War II, the Rightist ideas in the Communist Party of the USAA., of which Browder was the chief exponent, developed into an anti-Marxist revisionist-capitulationist line.
 From December 1943 onward, Browder advocated this line in a number of speeches and articles and in April 1944 he published Teheran, as his Right opportunist programme.
 Revising the basic Leninist thesis that imperialism is monopolistic, decadent and moribund capitalism, and denying the imperialist nature of USA capitalism, he declared that USA capitalism "retains some of the characteristics of a young capitalism" (Browder's italics) and that there is a "common interest" between the proletariat and the big bourgeoisie in the USAA.
 Thus he pleaded for the safeguarding of the system of monopolist trusts and dreamed about saving USA capitalism from inevitable crises by means of class conciliation.
 Basing himself on this absurd appraisal of USA capitalism and following a capitulationist line of class collaboration with monopoly capital, Browder in May 1944 presided over the dissolution of the Communist Party of the USAA., the party of the USA proletariat, and formed a non-Party organization, the Communist Political Association of the USAA. 
From the very beginning,
 Browder's wrong line met with opposition from many members of the Communist Party of the USAA. 
with Comrade William Z. 
Poster at their head.
 Under the leadership of Comrade Foster, the Communist Political Association in June 1945 passed a resolution denouncing Browder's line. 
In July the association held a special national convention and decided on the thorough liquidation of this line and the re-establishment of the Communist Party of the USAA.
 Browder was expelled from the Party in February 1946 because he persisted in his stand, which was a betrayal of the proletariat, and because he openly supported the imperialist policy of the Truman Administration and engaged in factional activities against the Party.

^fn1 On August 8, 1945, the Soviet government declared war on Japan. 
On August 10 the Mongolian government declared war on Japan. 
The Soviet Red Army moved by land and sea into China's Northeast and into Korea and swiftly routed the Japanese Kwantung Army. 
The joint Soviet-Mongolian armies crossed the Inner Mongolian desert and entered Jehol and Chahar Provinces. 
On August 10 the Japanese government was compelled to send a note begging to surrender and on the 14th it formally announced its unconditional surrender. 
The Kwantung Army was the cream of the main force of the Japanese army and constituted Japan's general strategic reserve. 
The Japanese imperialists had dreamed of relying on this force to carry on a long-drawn-out war from their favourable strategic position in China's Northeast and in Korea. 
This scheme was completely wrecked by the entry of the Soviet Union into the war, and the Japanese government had to admit defeat and surrender.
^fn2 For details, see "A Comment on the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Kuomintang's Central Executive Committee and the Second Session of the Third People's Political Council", , Vol. III.
^fn3 "Mountain" here refers to Mount Omei in Szechuan Province and more generally to the mountainous areas in southwestern and northwestern China. 
After Wuhan was occupied by the Japanese army in 1938, Chiang Kai-shek and the main force under his command took refuge in these mountainous areas and sat there watching the bitter struggle against the Japanese aggressors which was being waged behind the enemy lines by the army and people of the Liberated Areas.
^fn4 Prior to the War of Resistance Against Japan, most of the revolutionary base areas led by the Communist Party of China were in mountainous regions. 
At that time Chiang Kai-shek's rule was centred in the large cities along the big rivers and the coast. 
Accordingly, Comrade Mao Tse-tung said "we were on the mountain and he was by the water".
^fn5 During the War of Resistance the front lines were in northern, eastern, central and southern China. 
People usually referred to the Kuomintang areas in southwestern and northwestern China which were not occupied by the Japanese invaders as the Great Rear Area.
^fn6 The Northern Expedition was the punitive war against the Northern warlords launched by the revolutionary army which marched north from Kwangtung Province in May-July 1926. 
The Northern Expeditionary Army, with the Communist Party of China taking part in its leadership and under the Party's influence (the political work in the army was at that time mostly under the charge of Communist Party members), gained the warm support of the broad masses of workers and peasants. 
In the second half of 1926 and the first half of 1927 it occupied most of the provinces along the Yangtse and Yellow Rivers and defeated the Northern warlords. 
In April 1927 this revolutionary war failed as a result of betrayal by the reactionary clique under Chiang Kai-shek within the army.
^fn7 In 1924, with the help of the Communist Party of China, Sun Yat-sen reorganized the Kuomintang and effected co-operation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. 
The Revolutionary War of 1924-27 was launched on the basis of this cooperation. 
This first co-operation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party was wrecked as a result of betrayals by Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Ching-wei in 1927.
^fn8 This refers to Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the revolution in 1927. 
After betraying the revolution, Chiang Kai-shek massacred great numbers of Communists workers, peasants and revolutionary intellectuals and unleashed a counter-revolutionary war against the revolutionary masses.
^fn9 This Congress was held in Yenan in April 1945. 
It was there that Comrade Mao Tse-tung delivered the political report "On Coalition Government" (see , Vol. III).
^fn10 The first revolution was the anti-imperialist, anti-feudal revolutionary struggle waged from 1924 to 1927 by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China; the Northern Expedition was the main content of this revolution. 
The second revolution was the revolutionary struggle from 1927 to 1937 to create and develop Red political power. 
The third revolution was the War of Resistance Against Japan from 1937 to 1945.
^fn11 Chen Tu-hsiu was originally a professor at Peking University and became famous as an editor of New Youth. 
He was one of the founders of the Communist Party of China. 
Owing to his reputation at the time of the May 4th Movement and owing to the Party's immaturity in its initial period, he became General Secretary of the Party. 
In the last period of the revolution of 1924-27, the Rightist thinking in the Party represented by Chen Tu-hsiu developed into a line of capitulationism. 
In "The Present Situation and Our Tasks", Comrade Mao Tse-tung said that the capitulationists at that time "voluntarily gave up the Party's leadership of the peasant masses, urban petty bourgeoisie and middle bourgeoisie, and in particular gave up the Party's leadership of the armed forces, thus causing the defeat of the revolution" (p. 
171 of this volume). 
After the defeat in 1927 Chen Tu-hsiu and a handful of other capitulationists lost faith in the future of the revolution and became liquidationists. 
They took the reactionary Trotskyist stand and together with the Trotskyites formed a small anti-Party group. 
Consequently Chen Tu-hsiu was expelled from the Party in November 1929. He died in 1942. 
With reference to Chen Tu-hsiu's Right opportunism, see the introductory notes to "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and to "Report on the Investigation into the Peasant Movement in Hunan", , Vol. I, and "Introducing The Communist", , Vol. II.
^fn12 On July 21, 1945, the Provisional 59th Division and 2nd Cavalry Division under Hu Tsung-nan, Commander of the Kuomintang's 1st War Zone, suddenly attacked Yehtai Mountain in Chunhua County in the Kuanchung sub-region of the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region. 
On July 23 Hu Tsung-nan sent his 3rd Reserve Division to join in the attack. 
On July 27 our forces withdrew on their own initiative from Yehtai Mountain and forty-one villages west of it. 
The Kuomintang forces continued their attacks on Hsunyi, Yaohsien and other points. 
On August 8 our forces struck back at the invading Kuomintang troops and recovered the Yehtai mountain area.
^fn13 This slogan was raised by the "Left" opportunists during the period from October 1933 to October 1934 when the Red Army of the Central Base Area was repulsing the Kuomintang's fifth encirclement campaign. 
The slogan was diametrically opposed to the strategy formulated by Comrade Mao Tse-tung, which was to lure the enemy deep into our territory, concentrate a superior force and select the enemy's weak points in order to wipe him out in mobile warfare.
^fn14 In January 1941, as demanded by Chiang Kai-shek, the Headquarters of the New Fourth Army led by the Communist Party of China and the units under the direct command of this headquarters moved north from southern Anhwei Province to cross the Yangtse River. 
While on the march they were encircled and ambushed by Chiang Kai-shek's troops and lost more than 9,000, killed, wounded and captured. 
Chiang Kai-shek announced the cancellation of the designation of the New Fourth Army and ordered attacks against its other units. 
The event was called the Southern Anhwei Incident.
^fn15 During the War of Resistance the Kuomintang kept a staff officer in Yenan for liaison. 
"Ho" refers to Ho Ying-chin, Chief of the Kuomintang General Staff. 
On October 19 and December 8,1940, Chiang Kai-shek sent two telegrams in the names of Ho Ying-chin and Pai Chung-hsi, Deputy Chief of the Kuomintang General Staff, outrageously slandering the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, which were fighting stubbornly behind the Japanese lines, and arbitrarily ordering the people's anti-Japanese armed forces operating south of the Yellow River to withdraw north of the river within a definite time-limit. 
The Kuomintang reactionaries then launched a sudden attack on units of the New Fourth Army which were moving north and thus created the Southern Anhwei Incident. 
At that time the Communist Party of China pointed to Ho Ying-chin as the representative of the Kuomintang reactionaries who had launched the large-scale anti-Communist campaign, but actually Chiang Kai-shek was meant.
^fn16 The "People's Political Council" was an advisory body set up by the Kuomintang government after the start of the War of Resistance. 
Its members were all "selected" by the Kuomintang government; the majority belonged to the Kuomintang, and only a very few belonged to the Communist Party of China and other political parties. 
Moreover, the Kuomintang government did not recognize the equal and legal status of the parties which were opposed to Japanese aggression, nor did it allow their members to sit in the "People's Political Council" as representatives of their parties. 
One of the stipulations of the "Organic Rules of the People's Political Council" promulgated by the Kuomintang government was that those persons might become members of the Council "who have served in important cultural or economic organizations for three years or more and enjoy prestige, or those who devote themselves to affairs of state and have long enjoyed prestige". 
It was on the basis of this stipulation that the Kuomintang "selected" some counselors from the Communist Party of China.
^fn17 This refers to the commentary, "Chiang Kai-shek Is Provoking Civil War", written by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the Hsinhua News Agency, pp. 27-31 of this volume.

^fn19 The province of Chahar was abolished in 1952. 
The province of Jehol was abolished in 1955. 
The territories originally under their jurisdiction were transferred to Hopei, Shansi and Liaoning Provinces and the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region.
^fn20 From July to September 1931 Chiang Kai-shek personally held the post of commander-in-chief and moved 300,000 reactionary troops in an encirclement campaign against the Kiangsi Red Base Area. 
The Red Army smashed this encirclement campaign and won a great victory. 
For details, see "Strategic Problems of the Chinese Revolutionary War", Chapter 5, Section 5, , Vol. I.^fn21 The twenty-one county towns here referred to were Juichin, Huichang, Hsunwu, Anyuan, Hsinfeng, Yutu, Hsingkuo, Ningtu, Kuangchang, Shihcheng and Lichuan in Kiangsi Province, and Chienning, Taining, Ninghua, Chingliu, Kueihua, Lungyen, Changting, Liencheng, Shanghang and Yungting in Fukien Province.
^fn22 Pao-an was a county in the northwestern part of Shensi Province. 
It is now called Chihtan County. 
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China had its headquarters there from early July 1936 to January 1937. 
Later it moved to Yenan.
^fn23 The fortified village referred to was Tanpachai in the southwest of Pao-an County. 
There were over two hundred households in the village, which occupied a highly strategic position. 
Tsao Chun-chang, a landlord despot who headed a reactionary local armed band of over a hundred men, had long entrenched himself in this village. 
The Chinese Red Army repeatedly besieged the village but failed to capture it. 
In August 1936 the Red Army, while surrounding Tanpachai with the local armed forces, proceeded to win over the basic masses in the village and disintegrate the enemy from within. 
In December of the same year the bandit Tsao fled with a handful of his men, and Tanpachai was liberated.

Barrett, head of the USA Army Observer Group in Yenan. 
With the consent of the Communist Party of China, this group was sent to Yenan in 1944 by the USA forces fighting against Japan. 
Patrick J. Hurley, a reactionary politician of the Republican Party, came to China in September 1944 as the personal representative of the USA president and at the end of the year became USA ambassador to China. 
See "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains", Note 1, , Vol. III.
^fn26 The United States dropped an atom bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and another on Nagasaki on August 9. 
The propaganda organs of the United States and of the Kuomintang made much of the event, alleging that the Japanese government had surrendered because it was afraid of the USA atom bombs. 
By such propaganda they hoped to belittle the decisive role played by the entry of the Soviet Union into the war in compelling Japan to surrender.
^fn27 Mountbatten, then Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in Southeast Asia, made a statement on August 9, 1945, welcoming the entry of the Soviet Union into the war against Japan. 
He also said that the worst possible mistake would be to believe that the atom bomb could end the war in the Far East.

^fn1 On August 10, 1945, Commander-in-Chief Chu Teh issued an order from the General Headquarters in Yenan to all armed forces in the Liberated Areas concerning the surrender of the Japanese invaders. 
The order reads as follows:
Japan has announced her unconditional surrender, and the Allies will meet to discuss measures for accepting the surrender on the basis of the Potsdam Declaration.
 I hereby issue the following order to all our armed forces in the Liberated Areas:
(1) In accordance with the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration, any anti-Japanese armed forces in the Liberated Areas may serve notice on enemy troops and headquarters in cities and towns or along communication lines in the vicinity, requiring them to hand over all their arms to our fighting forces within a given time; when they have handed over their arms, our forces will protect their lives in accordance with our regulations on the lenient treatment of prisoners of war.
(2) Any anti-Japanese armed forces in the Liberated Areas may serve notice on all the puppet troops and puppet government organs in the vicinity, requiring them to come over with their troops to our side before the signing of the surrender by the Japanese invaders and to wait for reorganization and disbandment; those who fail to comply within the time allowed shall hand over all their arms.
(3) All anti-Japanese armed forces in the Liberated Areas should resolutely wipe out all those enemy and puppet armed forces which refuse to surrender and hand over their arms.
(4) Our armed forces have full authority to send their units to take over and occupy any city, town or communication line held by the enemy and the puppets, to set up military control, to maintain order and to appoint commissioners to take charge of all administrative matters there; in case of any act of sabotage or resistance, the culprits shall be punished as traitors.
Then, on August 11 the General Headquarters in Yenan issued six successive orders, under which the armed forces of the Shansi-Suiyuan Liberated Area (led by Comrade Ho Lung), the Shansi-Chahar-Hopei Liberated Area (led by Comrade Nieh Jung-chen) and the Hopei-Jehol-Liaoning Liberated Area were to march on Inner Mongolia and the Northeast, the armed forces of the Shansi Liberated Area were to mop up the Japanese and puppet troops along the Tatung-Puchow Railway and in the Fenho River valley; and the armed forces of all the Liberated Areas were to launch vigorous offensives on all the main communication lines under enemy control to compel the Japanese and puppet troops to surrender.
 The units of the People's Liberation Army in all the Liberated Areas resolutely carried out these orders and won important victories.
^fn2 Here "enemy" refers to the Japanese invading forces, and "puppets" refers to the puppet governments set up by the Japanese invaders and to the troops of these puppet governments, consisting largely of former Kuomintang officials and of troops who had surrendered to Japan.
^fn3 This refers to the declaration made by China, Britain and the United States at the Potsdam conference on July 26, 1945, requiring Japan to surrender. 
The main points of the declaration were that Japanese militarism must be eliminated for good and all, Japan's military forces must be completely disarmed; Japan's war industries must be dismantled; Japanese war criminals must be tried; the Cairo Declaration must be carried out, that is, Japan must renounce the territories she had stolen, such as Korea and China's Manchuria, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, and Japan's territory must be limited to the islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and various minor islands; and that the armed forces of the Allies were to occupy Japan until the establishment of a democratic Japanese government. 
The Soviet Union also signed the Potsdam Declaration after it declared war on Japan on August 8,1945.
^fn4 This refers to the dastardly practice of capitulating to Japan and fighting communism followed by the Kuomintang reactionaries during the War of Resistance Against Japan. 
The Kuomintang reactionaries directed part of their troops and government officials to surrender to the Japanese invaders and then, as puppet troops and officials, to join the Japanese troops in attacking the Liberated Areas, this was what they cunningly named "saving the nation by a devious path".

^fn7 Wang Ching-wei's puppet regime was in Nanking and Chiang Kai-shek's regime was in Chungking. 
The "merger of the Nanking and Chungking regimes" was a political plot hatched by Japanese imperialism and the pro-Japanese elements within the Kuomintang.
^fn8 Wang Ching-wei was a notorious Kuomintang leader and pro-Japanese traitor. 
He openly surrendered to the Japanese invaders in December 1938 when he was vice-chairman of the Kuomintang and chairman of its People's Political Council. 
In March 1940 he became president of the puppet central government then formed in Nanking. 
He died in Japan in November 1944.

^fn3 On July 7, 1937, Japanese invading forces attacked the Chinese garrison at Lukouchiao, ten kilometres southwest of Peking. 
Under the influence of the ardent anti-Japanese movement of the whole people, the Chinese troops there put up resistance. 
This incident marked the beginning of the Chinese people's heroic War of Resistance Against Japan which lasted for eight years.
^fn4 On August 10,1945, the Japanese government notified the Soviet Union, China, the United States and Britain of its desire to surrender. 
On August 11 the governments of the four countries replied that "all the Japanese military, naval and air authorities" and "all the forces under their control wherever located" must "cease active operations" and "surrender their arms".
^fn5 Yasuji Okamura was then commander-in-chief of the Japanese invading forces China. 
The order from Commander-in-Chief Chu Teh to Yasuji Okamura reads as follows:

^fn2 The Three People's Principles were the principles and programmes put forward by Sun Yat-sen on the questions of nationalism, democracy and people's livelihood in the bourgeois democratic revolution in China. 
In 1924, in the Manifesto of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang, a congress characterized by co-operation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, Sun Yat-sen restated the Three People's Principles, interpreted nationalism as opposition to imperialism and expressed active support for the movements of the workers and peasants. 
The old Three People's Principles thus developed into the new Three People's Principles with the Three Great Policies, that is, alliance with the Soviet Union, alliance with the Communist Party and assistance to the peasants and workers. 
The new Three People's Principles provided the political basis for the co-operation between the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang during the First Revolutionary Civil War period.
^fn3 This refers to the attack in July 1945 by Kuomintang troops on Chunhua, Hsunyi and Yaohsien in the Kuanchung sub-region of the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region.

^fn4 The "League for Banning Civil War" was formed in Shanghai in August 1932 with a mainly bourgeois membership. 
It issued a declaration calling for "ending the civil war and uniting to resist foreign aggression".
^fn5 In 1936 the Kuomintang's Northeastern Army headed by Chang Hsueh-liang and the Kuomintang's Northwestern Army headed by Yang Hu-cheng were stationed in and around Sian; they were charged with the task of attacking the Chinese Red Army which had arrived in northern Shensi. 
Influenced by the Chinese Red Army and the people's anti-Japanese movement, they agreed to the Anti-Japanese National United Front put forward by the Communist Party of China and demanded that Chiang Kai-shek unite with the Communist Party to resist Japan. 
Chiang Kai-shek turned down the demand, became even more active in his military preparations for the "suppression of the Communists" and massacred the anti-Japanese youth of Sian. 
Chang Hsueh-liang and Yang Hu-cheng took joint action and arrested Chiang Kai-shek. 
This was the famous Sian Incident of December 12, 1936. 
Chiang Kai-shek was forced to accept the terms of unity with the Communist Party and resistance to Japan and was then set free to return to Nanking.

^fn1 Around the time of Japan's surrender, the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain for a period all expressed disapproval of civil war in China. 
Events soon demonstrated, however, that the USA statement about its so-called disapproval of civil war in China was only a screen for actively helping the reactionary Kuomintang government prepare for a counter-revolutionary civil war.
^fn2 The three great slogans of peace, democracy and unity were put forward in the "Declaration on the Current Situation" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on August 25, 1945. 
The declaration pointed out that after the surrender of Japanese imperialism, "the important task confronting the whole nation is to consolidate unity in the country, safeguard domestic peace, bring about democracy and improve the people's livelihood so as, on the basis of peace, democracy and unity, to achieve national unification and build a new China, independent, free, prosperous and powerful".

^fn1 This refers to the "Summary of Conversations", also known as the "October 10th Agreement", which was signed by representatives of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China on October 10,1945. 
In the summary, Chiang Kai-shek had to feign agreement with the "basic policy of peace and national reconstruction" put forward by the Communist Party of China and accept "long-term co-operation on the basis of peace, democracy, solidarity and unity …resolute avoidance of civil war and the building of a new China, independent, free, prosperous and powerful" and "democratization of political life, nationalization of troops and equality and legality of political parties as ways and means absolutely essential for achieving peace and national reconstruction". 
He also had to agree to bring the Kuomintang's political tutelage to a speedy conclusion, convene a political consultative conference, "guarantee the freedoms of person, belief, speech, the press, assembly and association as enjoyed by the people in all democratic countries in peacetime, and abolish or amend existing laws and decrees according to this principle", abolish the secret services, "strictly prohibit all organs other than those of the judiciary and police from making arrests, conducting trials and imposing punishment", "release political prisoners", "actively carry out local self-government and conduct general elections from the lower level upward" etc. 
The Chiang Kai-shek government, however, stubbornly refused to recognize the legal status of the people's army and the democratic governments in the Liberated Areas and, on the pretexts of "unifying the military command" and "unifying government administration", insolently tried to eliminate altogether the people's army and the Liberated Areas led by the Communist Party of China; consequently no agreement could be reached on this question. 
The following are excerpts from the "Summary of Conversations" concerning the negotiations on the problem of the armed forces and political power in the Liberated Areas; in the "Summary" the so-called "Government" refers to Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang government.
"On the nationalization of troops.
 The Communist Party of China proposed that with a view to unifying the military command the Government should effect an equitable and rational reorganization of the armed forces of the whole country, draw up a programme for carrying it out in stages, make a fresh delimitation of the military zones and establish a conscription and replenishment system.
 The Communist Party of China stated that, given such a programme, it was ready to reduce the anti-Japanese troops under its command to twenty-four divisions or to a minimum of twenty divisions and to take prompt action to demobilize its anti-Japanese troops now distributed in the eight areas of Kwangtung, Chekiang, southern Kiangsu, southern Anhwei, central Anhwei, Hunan, Hupeh and Honan (not including northern Honan).
 The troops to be reorganized would be gradually withdrawn from the above areas to assemble in the Liberated Areas north of the Lunghai Railway and in northern Kiangsu and northern Anhwei.
 The Government stated that the programme for the reorganization of troops on a country-wide basis was under way and that the Government was willing to consider the reorganization of the anti-Japanese troops led by the Communist Party of China into twenty divisions, if the issues coming up in the present negotiations could all be settled.
 As to the question of the stationing of these troops, it stated further that the Communist Party of China could submit plans for discussion and decision.
 The Communist Party of China proposed that the Communist Party and its local military personnel should participate in the work of the National Military Council and its various departments, that the Government should preserve the existing personnel system and commission the existing personnel as officers of various ranks in the reorganized units, that officers not receiving appointment after reorganization should be assigned to different areas for training and that a fair and reasonable system for filling vacancies and a plan for political education should be adopted.
 The Government indicated that it had no objection to these proposals and was willing to discuss details.
 The Communist Party of China proposed that all the militiamen in the Liberated Areas should be organized into local self-defence corps.
 The Government indicated that such organization could be considered only where local conditions would so require or permit.
 In order to formulate concrete plans in regard to all the questions mentioned in this section, both sides agreed that a sub-committee of three be formed, with one representative each from the Board of Military Operations of the National Military Council, the Ministry of War and the Eighteenth Group Army."
"On local governments in the Liberated Areas.
 The Communist Party of China proposed that the Government should recognize the legal status of the popularly elected governments at all levels in the Liberated Areas.
 The Government indicated that, since Japan had surrendered, the term 'Liberated Area' should have become obsolete and that government administration throughout the country should be unified.
 The initial formula advanced by the Communist Party of China was that the provincial and administrative areas were to be delimited afresh in the light of the existence of eighteen Liberated Areas and that, for the sake of unifying government administration, it would submit a list of all the popularly elected government personnel at various levels for reappointment by the Government.
 The Government indicated that, as Chairman Chiang had stated to Mr Mao, the Central Government, after the unification of the military command and government administration throughout the country, would give consideration to the administrative personnel nominated by the Communist Party of China.
 The Government would consider retaining a due proportion of the administrative personnel who had served in the areas recovered during the War of Resistance, taking account of their record of ability and service, irrespective of party affiliation.
 Thereupon, a second formula was proposed by the Communist Party of China, asking the Central Government to appoint nominees of the Communist Party of China as chairmen and members of the provincial governments of the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region and the five provinces of Jehol, Chahar, Hopei, Shantung and Shansi, and to appoint the Communist Party's nominees as deputy chairmen and members of the six provincial governments of Suiyuan, Honan, Kiangsu, Anhwei, Hupeh and Kwangtung (because in the aforesaid eleven provinces there were extensive Liberated Areas or sections thereof).
 The Communist Party of China also requested the appointment of its nominees as deputy mayors of the four special municipalities of Peiping, Tientsin, Tsingtao and Shanghai and the participation of its nominees in the administration of the northeastern provinces.
 After many discussions on this matter, the Communist Party of China modified the aforesaid proposals by requesting the appointment of its nominees as chairmen and members of the provincial governments of the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region and the four provinces of Jehol, Chahar, Hopei and Shantung, as deputy chairmen and members of the two provincial governments of Shansi and Suiyuan and as deputy mayors of the three special municipalities of Peiping, Tientsin and Tsingtao.
In reply the Government stated that while the Communist Party of China might nominate those of its members who had rendered distinguished service during the War of Resistance and who possessed administrative ability to the Government for appointment, the Communist Party would not be sincerely endeavouring to achieve unity of military command and government administration if it should insist upon nominating a chairman or deputy chairman or members of any specific provincial government.
 The Communist Party of China then said it would withdraw its second suggestion and proposed a third formula.
 It suggested that general elections be held under the existing popularly elected governments at all levels in the Liberated Areas, and members of all other political parties as well as people in different walks of life would be welcome to return to their native places to take part in the elections to be held under the supervision of persons designated by the Political Consultative Conference.
 A popular election was to be held in any county where more than half the districts and townships had already held popular elections.
 Likewise, a popular election was to be held in any province or administrative area where more than half the counties had already held popular elections.
 In the interest of unity of government administration, the names of all the officials so elected in the provincial, administrative area and county governments should be submitted to the Central Government for appointment by confirmation.
 The Government replied that this formula of government confirmation of appointments in provinces and areas was not in the interest of unity of government administration.
 The Government might, however, consider holding popular elections for county officials, but popular elections for the provincial governments could be held only after the promulgation of a national constitution, when the status of the province would have been defined.
 For the time being, only those provincial government officials who had been appointed by the Central Government should proceed to take up their posts so that conditions in the recovered areas might be restored to normal at the earliest possible moment.
 At this point, a fourth formula was proposed by the Communist Party of China, namely, that the status quo in all the Liberated Areas should temporarily be maintained until the constitutional provision for the popular election of provincial governments had been adopted and put into effect and that, for the time being, an interim arrangement be worked out in order to guarantee the restoration of peace and order.
 The Communist Party of China stated that meanwhile this particular problem might be submitted to the Political Consultative Conference for settlement.
 The Government insisted that unity of government administration must be carried out first, because this problem, if left unsolved, might become an obstacle to peace and reconstruction, and it expressed the hope that a concrete formula with regard to this matter could be agreed upon soon.
 The Communist Party of China agreed to hold further discussions."
^fn2 Shangtang was an ancient name for the southeastern part of Shansi Province with Changchih as its centre. 
Its mountainous sections were the base of the 129th Division of the Eighth Route Army during the War of Resistance Against Japan and formed part of the Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan Liberated Area. 
In September 1945 the Kuomintang warlord, Yen Hsi-shan, mustered thirteen divisions and, in co-ordination with Japanese and puppet troops, moved in successively from Linfen, Fushan and Yicheng and from Taiyuan and Yutse to invade Hsiangyuan, Tunliu and Lucheng in the Southeastern Shansi Liberated Area. 
In October the army and people of this Liberated Area counter-attacked this invading force, wiped out 35,000 men and captured several high-ranking officers, including corps and division commanders.
^fn3 This refers to the experience gained by the Communist Party of China in its struggles with the Kuomintang from 1927, when the Kuomintang betrayed the revolution, to 1945.
^fn4 On September 18, 1931, the Japanese "Kwantung Army" quartered in northeastern China seized Shenyang. 
Under Chiang Kai-shek's order of "absolute non-resistance", the Chinese troops at Shenyang and elsewhere in the Northeast (the Northeastern Army) withdrew to the south of the Great Wall, and consequently the Japanese forces rapidly occupied the provinces of Liaoning, Kirin and Heilungkiang. 
The Chinese people called this act of aggression committed by the Japanese invaders the "September 18th Incident".

^fn9 From September 11 to October 2, 1945, the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, China, the United States, Britain and France met in London to discuss peace treaties with Italy, Rumania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Finland, countries which had taken part in the war of aggression started by fascist Germany, and to discuss the disposal of the Italian colonies. 
No agreement was reached because the United States, Britain and France rejected the reasonable proposals put forward by the Soviet Union and persisted in their imperialist policy of aggression aiming at overthrowing the people's governments set up in Rumania, Hungary and Bulgaria after victory in the anti-fascist war.

^fn1 At the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, most of China's railways were either under the control of the army and people of the Liberated Areas or surrounded by them. 
Under the pretext of "restoring communications", the Kuomintang reactionaries tried to utilize these railways to cut the Liberated Areas apart, transport millions of Kuomintang troops to northeastern, northern, eastern and central China, attack the Liberated Areas and grab the big cities.
^fn2 In September 1945, Kuomintang troops from the region of Chengchow and Hsinhsiang advanced along the Peiping-Hankow Railway to attack the Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan Liberated Area. 
In late October their vanguard, comprising three corps, invaded the region of Tsehsien and Hantan. 
The army and people of the Liberated Area rose bravely in self-defence, and after a week's bitter fighting General Kao Shu-hsun, Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang's 11th War Zone and concurrently Commander of the New 8th Corps, revolted against the Kuomintang at Hantan and came over to us with the New 8th Corps and one column, totalling over ten thousand men. 
The other two corps retreated in confusion but were surrounded and disarmed. 
Many high-ranking officers were compelled to surrender, including Ma Fa-wu, another Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang's 11th War Zone concurrently Commander of the 40th Corps, Liu Shih-jung, its Deputy Commander, Li Hsu-tung, its Chief of Staff, Liu Shu-sen, a Deputy Division Commander.
^fn3 After Japan's surrender the Kuomintang gathered more than twenty divisions from three war zones to launch large-scale attacks on the Liberated Areas in Honan and Hupeh Provinces. 
Part of the forces of Hu Tsung-nan, Commander of the Kuomintang's 1st War Zone, advanced from the northwest to the east along both sides of the Lunghai Railway to invade the Liberated Areas in western Honan; the forces of Liu Chih, Commander of the 5th War Zone, advanced from the north to the south along both sides of the Peiping-Hankow Railway to invade the Liberated Areas in central Honan and central and eastern Hupeh; the forces of the 6th War Zone advanced from southern Hupeh to the north in concert. 
Most of these Kuomintang forces were under the command of Liu Chih. 
The people's army of the Liberated Areas in Honan and Hupeh put up a stubborn fight against the invaders, conserved its strength and moved in late October 1945 to an area on the Honan-Hupeh border in the Tahung and the Tungpai Mountains and around Tsaoyang. 
The army later shifted to Hsuanhuatien, east of the Peiping-Hankow Railway, because the Kuomintang continued to pursue and attack.
^fn4 About the Shangtang battle, see "On the Chungking Negotiations", Note 2, p. 63 of this volume. 
The captured Kuomintang officers here mentioned were all high-ranking generals in Yen Hsi-shan's army.
^fn5 The province of Suiyuan was abolished on March 6, 1954, and became part of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region. 
General Fu Tso-yi was in 1945 Commander of the Kuomintang's 12th War Zone. 
His troops had been stationed at and around Wuyuan and Linho in western Suiyuan during the War of Resistance Against Japan. 
After Japan's surrender he was ordered to attack the Liberated Areas in Suiyuan, Jehol and Chahar Provinces. 
In August 1945 he occupied Kueisui (now Huhehot), Chining and Fengchen. 
In early September he occupied Hsingho, Shangyi, Wuchuan, Taolin, Hsintang and Liangcheng, launched massive attacks on the Liberated Areas in Chahar and pushed to the neighbourhood of Changchiakou. 
In self-defence our army repulsed these attacks and captured large numbers of his officers and men.
^fn6 The Handbook on Bandit Suppression was a counter-revolutionary pamphlet compiled by Chiang Kai-shek in 1933 dealing exclusively with methods of attacking the Chinese people's forces and the revolutionary bases. 
In 1945, after the conclusion of the War of Resistance, Chiang Kai-shek had it reprinted and issued to Kuomintang officers together with a confidential order, saying: "The present campaign for the suppression of the bandits, on which the happiness of the people depends, must be speedily completed. 
You should urge your officers and men to do their utmost to suppress the bandits in the spirit of the resistance against Japanese aggression and in accordance with the Handbook on Bandit Suppression which I have compiled. 
Any meritorious action in the service of the state shall be richly rewarded, and those responsible for delays or mistakes shall be court-martialled. 
This order should be made known to and obeyed by all officers and suppressing the bandits."

^fn1 On October 30, 1945, Kao Shu-hsun, Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang's 11th War Zone, revolted at the civil war front in Hantan, southern Hopei Province, and came over to our side with one corps and one column. 
This had a great influence throughout the country. 
In order to intensify the work of dividing and disintegrating the Kuomintang troops and arousing them to revolt, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to start a propaganda campaign calling upon other Kuomintang officers and men to follow the example of Kao Shu-hsun and his troops, refuse to attack the Liberated Areas, sabotage the civil war at the front, fraternize with the People's Liberation Army, rise in revolt and come over to the side of the people. 
This was known as the Kao Shu-hsun movement.
^fn2 See "Rent Reduction and Production Are Two Important Matters for the Defence of the Liberated Areas", pp. 71-73 of this volume.
^fn3 "Support the government and cherish the people" was a slogan of the People's Liberation Army, while "Support the army and give preferential treatment to the families of the armymen who fought in the War of Resistance" was a slogan of the Party organizations, government bodies, people's organizations and the masses of the people in the Liberated Areas. 
The second slogan was later changed into "Support the army and give preferential treatment to the families of the revolutionary armymen".
^fn4 On the evening of November 25, 1945, more than six thousand college and middle school students in Kunming, capital of Yunnan Province, assembled at the Southwest Associated University to discuss current affairs and protest against the civil war. 
The Kuomintang reactionaries sent troops who surrounded the assembly, fired on the students with light artillery, machine-guns and rifles and placed guards around the university to prevent teachers and students from going home. 
Subsequently, students from Kunming's schools and colleges joined in a strike. 
On December 1 the Kuomintang reactionaries dispatched a large number of soldiers and secret agents to the Southwest Associated University and the Teachers College where they threw hand-grenades, killing four people and wounding over ten. 
This incident was known as the "December 1st Massacre".

^fn1 The eastern Manchuria base area included Kirin, Hsi-an, Antu, Yenchi, Tunhua and other places east of the Shenyang-Changchun section of the Chinese Changchun Railway. 
The northern Manchuria base area included Harbin, Mutankiang, Pei-an and Kiamusze, among others. 
The western Manchuria base area included Tsitsihar, Tao-an, Kailu, Fuhsin, Chengchiatun, Fuyu and other places west of the Shenyang-Changchun section of the Chinese Changchun Railway. 
The Party also built a base area in southern Manchuria. 
It included Antung, Chuangho, Tunghua, Linchiang and Chingyuan and other places east of the Shenyang-Talien section of the Chinese Changchun Railway and Liaochung, southwest of Shenyang. 
The persistent struggle against the enemy in southern Manchuria played an important role in the building of base areas in the Northeast.
^fn2 This refers to the "Directive on Arousing the Masses" issued by the Jehol Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in December 1945. 
It pointed out that the central task in arousing the masses then was to launch a mass campaign of accusation and retribution to settle accounts with traitors and secret agents, that through the campaign the enthusiasm of the masses should be heightened, their social, political and economic status should be raised, and that trade unions, peasant associations and other mass organizations should be organized and that preparations should be made to proceed, when this campaign was over, to a mass campaign for the reduction of rent and interest. 
In arousing the masses in the cities, we had to arouse the workers first so that they could play the vanguard and leading role in the campaign to settle accounts with traitors and secret agents. 
The directive also called for learning the entire work of city administration, for making economical use of manpower and for planning everything on a long-term basis.

^fn1 The "truce agreement" was the agreement concluded on January 10, 1946 between representatives of the Communist Party of China and Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang government. 
It stipulated that the troops of both parties should cease military operations from their respective positions as of midnight, January 13. 
But in fact Chiang Kai-shek used this agreement as a smoke-screen behind which he made arrangements for a major war; at the very time the cease-fire order was being transmitted, he ordered the Kuomintang troops "to seize strategic points" and from then on moved up troops continuously to attack the Liberated Areas. 
By July Chiang Kai-shek had openly torn up the truce agreement and launched an all-out offensive against the Liberated Areas.
^fn2 The Political Consultative Conference was attended by representatives of the Kuomintang, the Communist Party of China and other political parties, and by personages without party affiliation and was held in Chungking from January 10 to 31, 1946. 
The Conference adopted five agreements:
(1) Agreement on Government Organization.
 This agreement affirmed that "the Organic Law of the National Government shall be revised with a view to strengthening the National Government Council". 
It increased the number of National Government Councillors and provided that "the National Government Councillors shall be chosen by the President of the National Government from both Kuomintang and non-Kuomintang members"; that "the appointment of members of various parties as National Government Councillors by the President of the National Government shall be made on the recommendation of the parties concerned, which, in case of the President's disapproval, shall make new recommendations"; that "when the President of the National Government nominates as Government Councillor any personage without party affiliation, whose appointment is opposed by one-third of the Councillors already appointed, the President must reconsider the matter and make a new nomination for appointment"; and that "half the National Government Councillors shall be Kuomintang members and the other half members of other political parties and public personages". 
The National Government Council was nominally defined as "the supreme government organ in charge of state affairs", with powers to discuss and decide legislative principles, administrative polices and major military measures, financial plans and the budget as well as matters submitted by the President of the National Government for consideration; yet at the same time the President of the National Government was vested with great powers, including the power of nominating persons for office, the power of veto (which, though nominally limited was virtually absolute, for it required a majority of three-fifths to override a veto, while the President's own party, the Kuomintang, had half the seats) and emergency powers. 
The agreement also provided that "seven or eight members of the Executive Yuan shall be non-Kuomintang members who shall either hold the portfolios of existing ministries or hold the proposed posts of ministers of state without portfolio".
(2) The Programme for Peace and National Reconstruction.

 The section on "Education and Culture" provided that "academic freedom shall be guaranteed, and there shall be no interference with school and college administration for reasons of religious belief or political thought"; that "the proportion of the national budget allocated to education and culture shall be increased"; and that "the war-time censorship of the press, publications, motion pictures, the drama, posts and telegrams shall be abolished".
(3) Agreement on the National Assembly.
 This agreement provided that "there shall be added to the National Assembly seven hundred delegates from various parties and from among public personages" and that "the duty and power of the first National Assembly shall be to frame and adopt a constitution".
(4) Agreement on the Draft Constitution.
 This agreement provided for the establishment of a review committee to revise the draft constitution prepared by the Kuomintang and laid down the principles for revision.
 In addition to prescribing the principles governing the duties and powers of the National Assembly and government organizations, special provisions were made regarding "local government" and "the rights and duties of the people".
 With respect to "local government", it provided that "the province shall be the highest unit of local self-government"; that "the powers of the provincial government in relation to those of the central government shall be defined according to the principle of a fair distribution of powers"; that "the provincial governor shall be elected by the people"; and that "the province may have a provincial constitution which, however, must not contravene the provisions of the national constitution".
 With respect to "the rights and duties of the people", it provided that "all freedoms and rights which are generally enjoyed by the people of a democratic country shall be protected by the constitution against illegal violation"; that "if any provision is made by law regarding the freedom of the people, it shall be at the protection of such freedom and not at its restriction"; that "drafting of labour may be provided for in local laws, but not in the national constitution"; and that "the right of self-government shall be guaranteed to minority nationalities who live together in specific communities".
(5) Agreement on Military affairs.
 This agreement provided that "the military system shall be reformed in line with a democratic system of government and the conditions in our country"; that "military conscription shall be improved"; that "military education shall be conducted on the basis of the principles governing the building of the army and shall for ever be dissociated from political parties and personal relationships"; that "military power shall be separated from political parties" and "all political parties and individuals shall refrain from using the army as an instrument of political struggle"; and that "military authority shall be separated from civil authority" and "no soldier in active service may serve concurrently as a civil official".
With regard to the reorganization of the Kuomintang troops and the troops of the Liberated Areas, it provided that "the three-man military sub-committee proceed as planned with all possible speed to reach an agreement on measures for reorganizing the troops of the Communist Party of China and to complete their reorganization"; 
that the Kuomintang troops shall "be reorganized according to the plan already laid down by the Ministry of War into ninety divisions and this reorganization shall be completed at the highest possible speed within six months"; and that "when the above-mentioned two items of reorganization have been completed, all troops of the entire nation shall be unified and further reorganized into fifty or sixty divisions".
These Political Consultative Conference agreements were, in varying degrees, favourable to the people and unfavourable to Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule.
 While expressing his approval of these agreements in an attempt to use them to carry out his peace fraud, Chiang Kai-shek actively made military preparations for launching a country-wide civil war.
 These Political Consultative Conference agreements were soon torn up by him one after another.

^fn1 To help Chiang Kai-shek start civil war against the people, USA imperialism gave his government a very great amount of aid. 
By the end of June 1946 the United States had equipped 45 Kuomintang divisions. 
It had trained 150,000 Kuomintang military personnel - army, naval and air forces, secret agents, communications police, staff officers, medical officers, supply personnel, etc. 
USA warships and aircraft transported to the front against the Liberated Areas 14 Kuomintang corps (41 divisions) and 8 regiments of the communications police corps, or over 540,000 men in all. 
The USA government landed 90,000 of its marines in China and stationed them at such important cities as Shanghai, Tsingtao, Tientsin, Peiping and Chinwangtao. 
They guarded the lines of communication for the Kuomintang in northern China. 
According to data disclosed in United States Relations with China (The White Paper), released by the State Department on August 5, 1949, the total value of various kinds of USA aid given to the Chiang Kai-shek government from the time of the War of Resistance Against Japan to 1948 was more than 4,500 million dollars (the overwhelming bulk of USA aid given during the War of Resistance had been hoarded by the Kuomintang for the ensuing civil war against the people). 
But the actual amount of USA aid to Chiang Kai-shek far exceeded this total. 
The USA White Paper admitted that USA aid was equivalent to "more than 50 percent of the monetary expenditures" of the Chiang Kai-shek government and was of "proportionately greater magnitude in relation to the budget of that Government than the United States has provided to any nation of Western Europe since the end of the war".
^c103
^fn1 The expressions "to destroy the enemy", "to wipe out the enemy" and "to annihilate the enemy" are used as synonyms in this book. 
They all include enemy troops killed, wounded and captured. 
To wipe out (annihilate, destroy) an enemy force means either to wipe it out completely or to wipe out the major part of that force.
^fn2 A regular corps of the Kuomintang army originally consisted of three (sometimes two) divisions, each with three regiments. 
Beginning in May 1946 the Kuomintang regular troops south of the Yellow River were reorganized in stages; what had been a corps became a reorganized division and with three (sometimes two) regiments. 
Part of the Kuomintang troops north of the Yellow River were not reorganized, and their designations remained the same. 
Some of the reorganized divisions later reverted to their original designation of corps.
^fn3 The communications police corps of the Kuomintang was formed in March 1945. 
Following Japan's surrender, the corps was deployed along communication lines for "garrison duties" under the pretext of guarding the railways, but actually to carry on secret police activities. 
It was one of the forces the Kuomintang used for fighting the civil war.
^fn4 In July 1946 the Kuomintang forces began a large-scale invasion of the Kiangsu-Anhwei Liberated Area, and our army fought bravely in self-defence. 
The Kuomintang troops attacking the Central Kiangsu Liberated Area consisted of fifteen brigades with about 120,000 men under Tang En-po. 
From July 13 to August 27, eighteen regiments of the Eastern China People's Liberation Army, commanded by Su Yu, Tan Chen-lin and other comrades, concentrated superior forces and fought seven successive battles in the region of Taihsing, Jukao, Hai-an and Shaopai in central Kiangsu. 
Our forces wiped out six enemy brigades and five battalions of the enemy's communications police corps. 
The text refers to the results of two of these battles.
^fn5 In August 1946 the Kuomintang forces advanced along two routes from the Hsuchow and Chengchow sectors and attacked the Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan Liberated Area. 
The People's Liberation Army of this area, under the command of Liu Po-cheng, Teng Hsiao-ping and other comrades, concentrated superior forces to engage the enemy detachment advancing from Chengchow. 
Between September 3 and 8 they wiped out four enemy brigades in succession in the region of Hotse, Tingtao and Tsaohsien in Shantung Province.
^fn6 Early in June 1946 the Shantung People's Liberation Army sent an expedition against the puppet troops along the Tsingtao-Tsinan and Tientsin-Pukow Railways and liberated more than ten towns, including Chiaohsien, Changtien, Choutsun, Tehchow, Tai-an and Tsaochuang.
^fn7 From August 10 to 21, 1946, the Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan People's Liberation Army, supporting the Central Plains and Eastern China People's Liberation Armies, moved by several routes and attacked the enemy troops stationed along the Kaifeng-Hsuchow section of the Lunghai Railway, capturing more than ten towns, including Tangshan, Lanfeng, Huangkou, Lichuang and Yangchi.
^fn8 In July 1946 the Kuomintang forces under Hu Tsung-nan and Yen Hsi-shan jointly attacked the Southern Shansi Liberated Area. 
The Taiyueh units of the Shansi-Hopei- Shantung-Honan People's Liberation Army and a part of the Shansi-Suiynan People's Liberation Army counter-attacked and beat back the enemy in southern Shansi. 
In August they started an offensive against the enemy between Linfen and Lingshih along the Tatung-Puchow Railway and liberated the towns of Hungtung, Chaocheng, Huohsien, Lingshih and Fenhsi.
^fn9 During the People's War of Liberation some landlords and local tyrants in the Liberated Areas fled to the Kuomintang areas. 
They were organized by the Kuomintang into "home-going contingents", "home-going legions" and other reactionary armed bands to attack the Liberated Areas together with the Kuomintang troops. 
Everywhere they robbed, killed and committed all kinds of atrocities.
^c104
^fn1 In December 1945 the USA government sent George C. 
Marshall to China as the president's special representative and used "mediation in the hostilities between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China" as a cover for strengthening the USA forces of aggression and the reactionary Kuomintang rule in various ways. 
To gain time to prepare for his civil war, Chiang Kai-shek, prompted by USA imperialism, pretended to accept the demand of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people to stop the civil war. 
In January 1946 representatives of the Kuomintang government and the Chinese Communist Party signed a truce agreement, issued a cease-fire order and formed the "Committee of Three" and the "Peiping Executive Headquarters" with the participation of USA representatives. 
During the "mediation", Marshall resorted to all kinds of ruses to help the Kuomintang forces attack the Liberated Areas, first in northeastern China and later in northern, eastern and central China; he actively trained and equipped the Kuomintang troops and supplied Chiang Kai-shek with a vast amount of arms and other war matériel. 
By June 1946 Chiang Kai-shek had massed 80 per cent of his regular forces (which were about two million men) at the front for attacks on the Liberated Areas; more than 540,000 of these troops were transported directly by the warships and planes of the USA armed forces. 
In July, when the disposition of his troops had been completed, Chiang Kai-shek launched a country-wide counter-revolutionary war. 
Subsequently, on August 10, Marshall and Leighton Stuart, USA ambassador to China, issued a joint statement declaring that "mediation" had failed in order to give Chiang Kai-shek a free hand to wage civil war.
^fn2 This refers to the agreement on China reached at the Moscow Conference of the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain in December 1945. 
In the conference communiqué the three foreign ministers "reaffirmed their adherence to the policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of China". 
The foreign ministers of the Soviet Union and the United States agreed that Soviet and USA forces should be withdrawn from China at the earliest possible time. 
The Soviet Union faithfully carried out the terms of this agreement. 
It was only because of repeated requests from the Kuomintang government that the Soviet forces postponed the date of withdrawal. 
On May 3, 1946, the armed forces of the Soviet Union completed their withdrawal from northeastern China. 
But the USA government broke its promise completely, refused to withdraw its troops and stepped up its interference in China's internal affairs.
^fn3 On two occasions, in June and August 1946, Chiang Kai-shek put forward his "five demands" to the Chinese Communist Party, declaring that only if the Communist Party accepted them would the Kuomintang consider stopping the civil war. 
The five demands stipulated that the Chinese People's Liberation Army withdraw from the following places: (1) all areas south of the Lunghai Railway; (2) the entire length of the Tsingtao-Tsinan Railway; (3) Chengteh and the area south of it; (4) most of northeastern China, and (5) all areas liberated since June 7, 1946, from the puppet troops in Shantung and Shansi Provinces by the people's armed forces of the Liberated Areas. 
The Chinese Communist Party categorically rejected all these counter-revolutionary demands.
^fn4 According to the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference held in January 1946, the National Assembly was to be an assembly of democracy and unity, in which various political parties would take part, and was to be convened under the auspices of a reorganized government after the terms of the agreements reached at the Political Consultative Conference had been carried out. 
On October 11, 1946, the Kuomintang troops occupied Changchiakou, and this "victory" turned the heads of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. 
On that very afternoon it openly violated the terms of the PCC resolution and ordered the convening of a divisive and dictatorial "National Assembly" controlled exclusively by the Kuomintang. 
Officially opened in Nanking on November 15, 1946, this "National Assembly" was firmly opposed and boycotted by the Chinese Communist Party, the democratic parties and the entire people.
^fn5 See "Smash Chiang Kai-shek's Offensive by a War of Self-Defence", Note 1, p. 92 of this volume.
^fn6 See the same article, Note 2, pp. 92-95 of this volume.
^c105
^fn1 See "Smash Chiang Kai-shek's Offensive by a War of Self-Defence", pp. 89-95 of this volume.
^fn2 Later developments showed that the situation between the enemy and ourselves began to change in July 1947, when the Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan People's Liberation Army forced the Yellow River and marched towards the Tapieh Mountains. 
By then the People's Liberation Army had fought for twelve months and wiped out about a hundred enemy brigades, averaging eight a month. 
This exceeded the estimate made in this article because, with the support of USA imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek had used all his available forces in the offensive.
^fn3 At the end of June 1946 the Central Plains Liberation Army led by Li Hsien-nien, Cheng Wei-san and other comrades initiated a strategic shift of its forces and victoriously broke through an encirclement by 300,000 Kuomintang troops. 
The units mentioned by Comrade Mao Tse-tung as having moved into the old Liberated Areas were those led by Wang Chen and other comrades; they entered the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region after breaking through the encirclement. 
The guerrilla base in southern Shensi was founded by a part of the main force of the Central Plains Liberation Army and included Lushih and Hsichuan in western Honan and Lonan and Shanyang in southern Shensi. 
The guerrilla base in western Hupeh was set up by another part of the same army with the Wutang Mountains in northwestern Hupeh as its centre.
^fn4 This refers to the "Directive on the Land Question" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on May 4, 1946. 
After Japan's surrender, in view of the peasants' eager demand for land, the Central Committee decided to change the land policy of the period of the War of Resistance, that is, to change from the reduction of rent and interest to confiscation of the land of the landlords and its distribution among the peasants. 
The "May 4th Directive" marked this change.
^fn5 The armed working teams were small working teams which went deep into the enemy-occupied areas to organize the masses and strike blows at the enemy. 
Such a team consisted of cadres drawn from various organizations -- the Communist Party, the governments in the Liberated Areas, the people's army and mass organizations -- and was equipped with some weapons. 
This was a convenient form of organization for carrying out activities in the enemy-occupied areas.
^fn6 This refers to land taxes in kind.
^fn7 The national bourgeoisie is the section of the bourgeoisie which has little or no connection with imperialism, as distinguished from that section of the bourgeoisie which is closely dependent on imperialism and is comprador in character, that is, the big bourgeoisie or bureaucrat-capitalists.
^c106
^fn1 Beginning in August 1946 the Kuomintang authorities in Shanghai forbade the street vendors in the Whangpoo and Louza districts to carry on their business. 
In late November nearly a thousand who were still operating were arrested. 
On November 30 three thousand street vendors demonstrated and surrounded the Whangpoo district police station. 
The Kuomintang authorities gave the order to fire; seven demonstrators were killed and a great many were wounded and arrested. 
On December 1, the street vendors continued their struggle. 
Despite the fact that ten more were killed and over a hundred wounded, the number taking part in the struggle grew to over five thousand. 
All shops in Shanghai closed down to show sympathy. 
Thus the incident developed into a city-wide mass movement against Chiang Kai-shek.
^fn2 This incident occurred in Peiping on December 24, 1946. 
A girl student of Peking University was raped by USA soldiers. 
Consequently, from December 30 through January 1947, students in scores of big and medium cities in the Kuomintang areas struck and demonstrated against the United States and Chiang Kai-shek, demanding the withdrawal of USA troops from China. 
More than half a million students took part in this movement.
^fn3 In 1935 a new upsurge began in the patriotic movement of the people of the whole country. 
Students in Peking, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, were the first to hold a patriotic demonstration on December 9, putting forward such slogans as "Stop the civil war and unite to resist foreign aggression" and "Down with Japanese imperialism!" This movement broke open the long reign of terror imposed by the Kuomintang government in league with the Japanese invaders and soon won the support of the people throughout the country. 
It is known as the "December 9th Movement". 
As a consequence, new changes became manifest in the relations among various classes in the country, and the Anti-Japanese National United Front proposed by the Communist Party of China became the openly advocated policy of all patriotic people. 
The Kuomintang government became very isolated with its traitorous policy.
^fn4 The "three thirds system" was the Chinese Communist Party's policy for united front organs of political power in the Liberated Areas during the War of Resistance Against Japan. 
According to this policy, the proportion of personnel in the and-Japanese democratic political organs was about one-third each for Communist Party members, for left progressives, and for middle elements and others.
^fn5 See "The Present Situation and Our Tasks", Section 6, pp. 167-69 of this volume.
^fn6 The "Sino-USA Treaty of Commerce" or "Sino-USA Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation" was concluded between the Chiang Kai-shek government and the USA government on November 4, 1946, in Nanking. 
This treaty, which sold out a large part of China's sovereignty to the United States, contains thirty articles, the main contents of which are as follows:
(1) USA nationals shall enjoy in "the whole extent of …the territories" of China the rights to reside, travel, carry on commercial, manufacturing, processing, scientific, educational, religious and philanthropic activities, explore and exploit mineral resources, lease and hold land, and follow various occupations and pursuits.
 In regard to economic rights USA nationals in China shall be accorded the same treatment as Chinese.
(2) In respect of taxation, sale, distribution and use in China, USA commodities shall be accorded treatment no less favourable than that accorded to the commodities of any third country or to Chinese commodities.
 "No prohibition or restriction shall be imposed" by China on the importation from the United States of any article grown, produced or manufactured in the United States, or on the exportation to the United States of any Chinese article.
(3) USA vessels shall have the freedom of sailing in any of the ports, places or waters in China which are open to foreign commerce or navigation, and their personnel and freight shall have freedom of transit through Chinese territory "by the routes most convenient". 
On the pretext of "any …distress", USA vessels including warships, can sail into "any of the ports, places or waters" of China which are "not open to foreign commerce or navigation".
Wellington Koo, then Chiang Kai-shek's ambassador to the United States, openly and shamelessly stated that this treaty meant "the opening of the entire territory of China to USA merchants".
^fn7 The Youth Party was the shortened name of the Chinese Youth Party, also called the Étatiste Party; its predecessor was the Chinese Étatiste Youth League. 
This party was composed of a handful of fascist politicians. 
They made counter-revolutionary careers for themselves by opposing the Communist Party and the Soviet Union and therefore received subsidies from various groups of reactionaries in power and from the imperialists.
^fn8 The Democratic Socialist Party was formed in August 1946 through the merger of the Democratic Constitutional Party and the National Socialist Party. 
It consisted mainly of reactionary politicians and feudal dregs from the time of the Northern warlords.
^fn9 "Certain so-called public personages" refers to shameless politicians like Wang Yun-wu, Fu Sze-nien and Hu Cheng-chih, who posed as persons with no party affiliation and served as a window-dressing for Chiang Kai-shek's "National Assembly".
^fn10 On January 16, 1947, because of repeated setbacks in its military offensives and because of its worsening military situation, the Kuomintang government, in an attempt to gain a respite and prepare a fresh offensive, asked the Chinese Communist Party, through the USA ambassador to China, Leighton Stuart, for permission to send delegates to Yenan for "peace negotiations". 
This new USA-Chiang deception was promptly and thoroughly exposed by the Chinese Communist Party. 
The Chinese Communist Party pointed out that negotiations could be renewed only if two minimum conditions were fulfilled: (1) the bogus constitution framed and adopted by the Kuomintang in violation of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference had to be abolished, and (2) Kuomintang troops had to evacuate all the territory of the Liberated Areas they had occupied since the truce agreement went into effect on January 13, 1946; otherwise, there would be no guarantee that the Kuomintang would not again tear up any agreement reached in renewed negotiations. 
The Kuomintang government realized that the ruse of "peace" did not work and on February 27 and 28 it notified all the representatives of the Chinese Communist Party stationed in Nanking, Shanghai and Chungking for negotiations and liaison that they had to leave and announced the complete breakdown of the negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

See "A Three Months' Summary", Note 4, p. 118 of this volume.
^fn14 "Evening up" was a policy adopted in the old Liberated Areas; where a comparatively thorough land reform had been carried out. 
The purpose was to solve the problem of insufficient land and other means of production among some of the poor peasants and farm labourers and other problems left over from the reform. 
The method was, on a limited scale, to take from those who had better and give to those who had worse, to take from those who had a surplus and give to those who had a shortage, so that the distribution of land and other means of production could be rationally readjusted.
^c107
^fn1 The statistics were for the period from early July to November 13, 1946.
^fn2 On February 27-28, 1947, the representatives and personnel of the Chinese Communist Party stationed in Nanking, Shanghai and Chungking for negotiations and liaison were forced by the Kuomintang government to leave within a stated time. 
On March 15, 1947, the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang convened its third plenary session, at which Chiang Kai-shek proclaimed the Kuomintang's break with the Communist Party and his determination to fight the civil war to the finish.
^c108
^fn1 Having withdrawn from Yenan on its own initiative, the Northwest People's Liberation Army sent out a small force to lure the enemy's main force as far as Ansai, northwest of Yenan, while leaving its main force to ambush the enemy in the Chinghuapien sector, northeast of Yenan. 
On March 25, 1947, a Kuomintang regiment of the 31st Brigade of Hu Tsung-nan's Reorganized 27th Division, led by the brigade headquarters, walked right into this trap and was completely destroyed in a battle lasting just over an hour.
^fn2 Liao Ang, Commander of the Reorganized 76th Division of the Kuomintang forces under Hu Tsung-nan, was later captured in a battle at Chingchien on October 11, 1947.
^c109
^fn1 After December 1946 the democratic and patriotic movement of the broad masses of students in the Kuomintang areas against hunger, civil war and persecution gathered new momentum with the development of the People's War of Liberation and gradually became a second front in the struggle against Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule. 
In late December 1946 and early January 1947, more than 500,000 students in scores of big and medium cities, including Peiping, Tientsin, Shanghai and Nanking, went on strike and held demonstrations in protest against the atrocity of the raping of a Peking University girl student perpetrated by USA soldiers and demanded the withdrawal of USA armed forces from China. 
This struggle won the immediate support of workers, teachers and other people. 
On May 4, 1947, students in Shanghai demonstrated against the civil war. 
At the same time eight thousand workers and students besieged the Kuomintang police headquarters. 
The patriotic movement soon spread to Nanking, Peiping, Hangchow, Shenyang, Tsingtao, Kaffeng and many other cities. 
The Kuomintang reactionaries resorted to extremely brutal measures to suppress the students' patriotic and democratic movement. 
On May 20 more than a hundred students were wounded and arrested in Nanking and Tientsin in the notorious "Bloody Incident of May 20th". 
Nevertheless, the patriotic student movement, supported by the broad masses of the people, could not be quelled. 
The students' strikes and demonstrations under the slogan, "Against Hunger, Against Civil War, Against Persecution", and the people's anti-USA and anti-Chiang Kai-shek struggles, such as strikes of workers and teachers, spread to more than sixty large and medium cities. 
In May 1948 the students in Shanghai, together with cultural workers, journalists and people from other walks of life, started a patriotic movement against the revival of the Japanese forces of aggression fostered by the United States, a movement which also spread rapidly to many other cities. 
The patriotic struggles of the students never ceased until the country-wide victory; they struck heavy blows at the Kuomintang.
^fn2 Promulgated on May 18, 1947 by the Chiang Kai-shek government, these measures strictly prohibited the presentation of petitions by more than ten persons together and forbade all strikes by workers and students and all demonstrations. 
They also authorized the Kuomintang local authorities to take "necessary steps" and "emergency measures" for the sanguinary suppression of the patriotic and democratic movements of the people.
^fn3 On May 4, 1919, students in Peking demonstrated against the handing over to Japan of many of China's sovereign rights in Shantung by Britain, the United States, France, Japan, Italy and other imperialist countries then in conference in Paris. 
This student movement evoked an immediate response throughout the country. 
After June 3, it developed into a country-wide and-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary movement embracing large numbers of the proletariat, the urban petty bourgeoisie and even the national bourgeoisie.
^c110
^fn1 This strategic counter-offensive in the Northeast, Jehol and eastern Hopei was the 1947 summer offensive of the Northeast People's Liberation Army. 
On May 13, the People's Liberation Army began simultaneous offensives on these fronts and by July 1 had wiped out over 80,000 enemy troops and recovered more than 40 county towns. 
The enemy plan of cutting up the Liberated Areas in northeastern China was thus completely wrecked. 
The enemy troops, driven into two narrow corridors along the Chinese Changchun Railway and the Peiping-Liaoning Railway, were forced into the "defence of key points". 
This changed the whole situation in northeastern China. 
The strategic counter-offensive in southern Shansi and northern Honan comprised the offensives launched by the Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan People's Liberation Army in northern Honan and on the flanks of the Tatung-Puchow Railway in southern Shansi between March and May 1947. 
Our army in northern Honan started attacking on March 23. 
After taking Yenchin, Yangwu, Puyang and Fengchiu one after another, our army turned north to exploit these successes. 
By May 28 it had captured Tsihsien, Chunhsien, Huahsien and Tangyin and wiped out over 45,000 enemy troops. 
Our troops in southern Shansi began offensive operations on April 4. 
By May 4 they had captured twenty-two county towns, including Chuwo, Hsinchiang and Yungtsi, and two important ferry crossings on the Yellow River, Yumenkou and Fenglingtu, and had wiped out over 18,000 enemy troops.
^fn2 The Laiwu campaign was a campaign of mobile warfare fought by the Eastern China People's Liberation Army in the Laiwu region, southeast of Tsinan, Shantung Province. 
Towards the end of January 1947 the Kuomintang troops launched an offensive against the Shantung Liberated Areas from both the north and the south. 
From the south, eight Kuomintang reorganized divisions drove northward by three routes along the Yiho and Shuho Rivers towards Linyi and from the north, in coordination with them, three Kuomintang corps belonging to the Li Hsien-chou group advanced southward on Laiwu and Hsintai from Mingshui, Tsechuan and Poshan, seeking to engage the main force of the Eastern China People's Liberation Army in a decisive battle in the Yi-Meng mountain area. 
Our army used part of its forces to block the enemy from the south but marched its main force north towards Laiwu to destroy the Li Hsien-chou group. 
All the enemy troops, over 60,000 men, were wiped out in a battle which started on February 20 and ended on the afternoon of February 23. 
Li Hsien-chou, Deputy Commander of the 2nd Pacification Zone of the Kuomintang's Hsuchow Pacification Headquarters, was captured, and thirteen towns were recovered.
^fn3 This Southwestern Shantung campaign was the campaign fought by the Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan People's Liberation Army in July 1947 in the region of Hotse, Yuncheng, Chuyeh, Tingtao, Chinhsiang and Tsaohsien, in southwestern Shantung Province. 
In this campaign 4 Kuomintang division headquarters and 9 brigades, totalling more than 56,000 men, were wiped out.

^fn3 The "four pledges" were made by Chiang Kai-shek at the opening session of the Political Consultative Conference in 1946. 
They were, to guarantee freedom of the people, to guarantee the legal status of political parties, to hold a general election and to release political prisoners.
^fn4 By miscellaneous troops are meant the Kuomintang's irregular troops which included the local peace preservation corps, communications police corps, gendarmes, the puppet troops taken over and reorganized by the Kuomintang, etc.
^fn5 The Japanese invaders carried out the policy of three atrocities -- burn all, kill all, loot all -- against the Liberated Areas in China.
^fn6 On July 4, 1947, the reactionary Kuomintang government adopted Chiang Kai-shek's "General Mobilization Bill" and immediately afterwards issued the "Order for General Mobilization to Suppress the Insurrection of the Communist Bandits". 
In fact, Chiang Kai-shek had carried out a general mobilization for his counterrevolutionary civil war much earlier. 
By that time the Chinese People's Liberation Army had begun to shift to a country-wide offensive. 
Chiang Kai-shek himself admitted that his regime was in a "serious crisis". 
The "Order for General Mobilization" was merely his dying kick.
^fn7 This refers to the "Sino-USA Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation" concluded between the Chiang Kai-shek government and the USA government on November 4, 1946. 
The treaty sold out China's sovereign rights to the United States. 
See "Greet the New High Tide of the Chinese Revolution", Note 6, p. 126 of this volume.
^fn8 Yuan Shih-kai was the head of the Northern warlords in the last years of the Ching Dynasty. 
After the Ching Dynasty was overthrown by the Revolution of 1911, he usurped the presidency of the Republic and organized the first government of the Northern warlords, which represented the big landlord and big comprador classes; he did this by relying on a counter-revolutionary armed force and the support of the imperialists and by taking advantage of the compromising nature of the bourgeoisie then leading the revolution. 
In 1915 he wanted to make himself emperor and, to gain the support of the Japanese imperialists, he accepted Japan's Twenty-one Demands which were designed to obtain exclusive control of all China. 
In December of the same year an uprising against his assumption of the throne took place in Yunnan Province and promptly won country-wide response and support. 
Yuan Shih-kai died in June 1916.

^fn1 The Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention were the rules of discipline laid down by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army during the Second Revolutionary Civil War. 
They formed an important part of the political work of the Red Army and played a great role in building the people's armed forces, handling relations within the army correctly, forging unity with the masses of the people and laying down the correct policy of the people's army towards captives. 
From the earliest days of the Red Army, Comrade Mao Tse-tung required the soldiers to speak politely to the masses, pay fairly for all purchases and never impress people into forced labour or hit or swear at people. 
In the spring of 1928, when the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army was in the Chingkang Mountains, Comrade Mao Tse-tung set down Three Rules of Discipline: (1) Obey orders in your actions; (2) Don't take anything from the workers and peasants; and (3) Turn in all things taken from local bullies. 
In the summer of 1928 he set forth Six Points for Attention: (1) Put back the doors you have taken down for bed-boards; (2) Put back the straw you have used for bedding; (3) Speak politely; (4) Pay fairly for what you buy; (5) Return everything you borrow; and (6) Pay for anything you damage. 
After 1929 Comrade Mao Tse-tung made the following changes: Rule 2 became "Don't take a single needle or piece of thread from the masses", and Rule 3 was changed first to "Turn in all money raised" and then to "Turn in everything captured". 
To the Six Points for Attention he added two more: "Don't bathe within sight of women" and "Don't search the pockets of captives". 
This was the origin of the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention.

^fn3 For the directive, see "A Three Months' Summary", Note 4, p. 118 of this volume.
^fn4 The National Land Conference of the Communist Party of China was held in September 1947 in Hsipaipo Village, Pingshan County, Hopei Province. 
The Outline Land Law of China, adopted by the conference on September 13, was published by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on October 10, 1947. 
It stipulated the following:
Abolish the land system of feudal and semi-feudal exploitation and put into effect the system of land to the tillers.
All the land of the landlords and the public land in the villages is to be taken over by the local peasant associations and, together with all other land there, is to be equally distributed among the entire rural population, regardless of sex or age.
The peasant associations of the villages shall take over the draught animals farm tools, houses, grain and other property of the landlords, requisition the surplus of such property of the rich peasants, distribute all this property among the peasants and other poor people who are in need of it and allot the same share to the landlords.
Thus the Outline Land Law not only confirmed the principle of "confiscation of the land of the landlords and its distribution among the peasants" laid down in the "May 4th Directive" of 1946 but also made up for the lack of thoroughness in that directive, which had shown too much consideration for certain landlords.
^fn5 Subsequently in the implementation some changes were made in the method of equal distribution of land provided in the Outline Land Law of China. 
In February 1948 the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China specified in its "Directive on the Work of Land Reform and of Party Consolidation in the Old and Semi-Old Areas that in the old and semi-old Liberated Areas where the feudal system had already been overthrown, there would be no further equal distribution of land, but that the poor peasants and farm labourers who had not yet completely shaken off the feudal yoke should, if circumstances so required, be given a certain amount of land and other means of production through readjustment, by the method of taking from those who had a surplus and giving to those who had a shortage and taking from those who had better and giving to those who had worse, while the middle peasants would be allowed to keep more land than the average poor peasant. 
In areas where the feudal system still existed, equal distribution was confined mainly to the land and property of landlords and the surplus land and property of old-type rich peasants. 
In all areas, it was permissible to take the surplus land of middle peasants and new-type rich peasants for purposes of readjustment only if this was actually necessary and if the owners really consented. 
In the land reform in the new Liberated Areas, no land was to be taken from any middle peasant.
^fn6 The question of the rich peasants in China's land reform was a peculiar one arising from her specific historical and economic conditions. 
China's rich peasants differed from those in many capitalist countries in two respects: first, they generally and to a great degree had the character of feudal and semi-feudal exploiters and, second, this rich peasant economy did not occupy an important place in the country's agricultural economy. 
In the struggle against feudal exploitation by the landlord class in China, the broad masses of poor peasants and farm labourers also demanded the abolition of feudal and semi-feudal exploitation by the rich peasants. 
During the War of Liberation, the Communist Party of China adopted the policy of requisitioning the surplus land and property of rich peasants for distribution among the peasants, and thus satisfied the demands of the masses of poor peasants and farm labourers and ensured victory in the People's War of Liberation. 
As the war progressed towards victory, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in February 1948 laid down new policies for the land reform in the new Liberated Areas. 
The reform was to be divided into two stages: in the first stage, neutralize the rich peasants and concentrate the blows on the landlords, primarily the big landlords; in the second stage, while distributing the land of the landlords, also distribute the land rented out by rich peasants and their surplus land, but continue to treat the rich peasants differently from the landlords (see "Essential Points in Land Reform in the New Liberated Areas", pp. 201-02 of this volume). 
After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Central People's Government in June 1950 promulgated the Land Reform Law, which provided that in the land reform only the land rented out by the rich peasants should partly or wholly be requisitioned, while the rest of their land and property was to be protected. 
In the subsequent stage of socialist revolution, the rich peasant economy disappeared as the movement for agricultural co-operation deepened and the rural economy developed.
^fn7 That is to say, a rich peasant household owned on the average more and better land than a poor peasant household. 
Taking the country as a whole, the quantity of the means of production owned by China's rich peasants and the volume of their farm produce were both very small. 
The rich peasant economy did not occupy an important place in China's rural economy.
^fn8 This refers to the movement for rectifying the style of work conducted by the Communist Party of China in 1942-43 throughout the Party; its content was the combating of subjectivism, sectarianism and stereotyped writing. 
Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Tse-tung, this rectification movement adopted the principles of "learning from past mistakes to avoid their repetition, curing the sickness to save the patient" and "clearing up wrong thinking while uniting with comrades". 
Through the method of criticism and self-criticism, the movement corrected the "Left" and Right errors which had occurred on various occasions in the history of the Party by getting down to their ideological roots, greatly raised the ideological level of the broad ranks of Party cadres, helped immensely to unify thinking within the Party on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and thus brought about a high degree of unity in the whole Party.
^fn9 In the early stage of the People's War of Liberation some democratic personages fancied that they could find a so-called third road, apart from the Kuomintang dictatorship of big landlords and big bourgeoisie and apart from the people's democratic dictatorship led by the Communist Party of China. 
This third road was in fact the road of a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie on the British and USA pattern.
^fn10 The Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties was founded at a meeting held in Warsaw, Poland, in September 1947 by representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of Bulgaria, Rumania, Hungary, Poland, the Soviet Union, France, Czechoslovakia, Italy and Yugoslavia. 
Later, at a meeting in Rumania in June 1948, the Bureau announced the expulsion of the Yugoslav Communist Party because the latter persisted in its anti-Marxist-Leninist stand and adopted an attitude opposed to the Soviet Union and the socialist camp. 
The Information Bureau's call to the people of the world to rise against the imperialist plan of enslavement, mentioned here by Comrade Mao Tse-tung, was the "Declaration on the International Situation" adopted at the September 1947 meeting of the Information Bureau.

^fn2 .The new rich peasants were those who had developed from middle peasants or poor peasants in the revolutionary base areas. 
The old rich peasants were those who had already been rich peasants before the revolutionary base areas were established. 
The old rich peasants generally and to a great degree had the character of feudal and semi-feudal exploiters.

^fn3 Labour-exchange teams and work-exchange groups were organizations for mutual aid and co-operation in agriculture, "Labour-exchange" or "work-exchange" was a means by which the peasants adjusted labour-power among themselves and took such forms as the exchange of man-workdays for man-workdays, ox-workdays for ox-workdays and man-workdays for ox-workdays. 
Peasants who joined labour-exchange teams contributed their labour-power or animal-power to cultivate the land of each member-family in rotation or collectively. 
In settling accounts the workday was taken as the unit of exchange; those who contributed more man-workdays or animal-workdays were paid for the difference by those who contributed less.

^fn1 The "Three Check-ups" and "Three Improvements" constituted an important movement for Party consolidation and for ideological education in the army which was carried out by our Party in conjunction with the land reform during the People's War of Liberation. 
In the localities, the "Three Check-ups" meant checking on class origin, ideology and style of work; in the armed units, the check-ups were on class origin, performance of duty and will to fight. 
The "Three Improvements" meant organizational consolidation, ideological education and rectification of style of work.

^fn4 Starting from June 30, 1947, 7 columns of the Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan Field Army led by Liu Po-cheng, Teng Hsiao-ping and other comrades forced the Yellow River and pushed towards the Tapieh Mountains, thus ushering in the strategic offensive of the People's Liberation Army. 
By the end of March 1948, more than 100,000 enemy troops had been wiped out, and new base areas had been built on the Hupeh-Honan border, in western Anhwei, in the Tungpai mountain area on the Hupeh-Honan border, the plains between the Yangtse and Han Rivers and other places. 
Eight columns of the Eastern China Field Army led by Chen Yi, Su Yu and other comrades, having smashed the enemy's concentrated attacks on Shantung Province in August 1947, swept into southwestern Shantung and the Honan-Anhwei-Kiangsu Border Region, wiped out over 100,000 enemy troops, built the Honan-Anhwei-Kiangsu Liberated Area and isolated the enemy's strategic centres of Kaifeng and Chengchow. 
Two columns and one corps of the Taiyueh Army of the Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan area, commanded by Chen Keng, Hsieh Fu-chih and other comrades, forced the Yellow River in southern Shansi in August 1947, advanced into western Honan, wiped out more than 40,000 enemy troops and built base areas on the Honan-Shensi-Hupeh border and in southern Shensi, completely isolating Loyang, the enemy's strategic centre in western Honan Province, and threatening Tungkuan.
^fn6 Fighting continuously for ninety days from December 15, 1947 to March 15, 1948, 10 columns and 12 independent divisions of the Northeast Field Army led by Lin Piao, Lo Jung-huan and other comrades waged a winter offensive on an unprecedented scale along the Szepingkai-Tashihchiao section of the Chinese Changchun Railway and the Shanhaikuan-Shenyang section of the Peiping-Liaoning Railway; they wiped out more than 156,000 enemy troops and captured the enemy's heavily-fortified strategic centre of Szepingkai and eighteen other cities. 
One enemy division garrisoning Yingkow revolted and came over to our side. 
The enemy force defending the city of Kirin fled towards Changchun. 
After this, the area under enemy control in the Northeast shrank to only 1 per cent of the whole, and the enemy lairs in the cities along the Changchun-Shenyang-Chinchow line were isolated.
^fn5 From early September to mid-November 1947, 5 columns of the Shansi-Chahar-Hopei Field Army led by Nieh Jung-chen and other comrades fought successive battles in the area north of the Taching River and in the Chingfengtien area and the battle for the liberation of Shihchiachuang, wiping out a total of nearly 50,000 enemy troops and linking up the Shansi-Chahar-Hopei and Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan Liberated Areas into one contiguous territory. 
From September to December 1947, 3 columns of the Shantung Army belonging to the Eastern China Field Army and regional armed forces fought the Eastern Shantung campaign under the command of Hsu Shih-yu, Tan Chen-lin and other comrades, wiping out more than 63,000 of the enemy and recovering more than ten county towns; this changed the whole situation in Shantung Province. 
From August to December 1947, units of the Eastern China Field Army in northern Kiangsu, in successive battles at Yencheng, Lipao and other points, annihilated more than 24,000 enemy troops and recovered a wide area in northern Kiangsu. 
In December 1947, units of the Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan Field Army led by Hsu Hsiang-chien and other comrades fought in co-ordination with units of the Northwest Field Army and captured Yuncheng, destroying more than 13,000 enemy troops; they wiped out all the enemy forces in southwestern Shansi and isolated the enemy at Linfen.
^fn7 In the spring of 1948, following a period of training and consolidation in the previous winter, the field armies of the People's Liberation Army launched successive offensives. 
Between March and May, the Shansi-Chahar-Hopei Field Army and units of the Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan and Shansi-Suiyuan Field Armies campaigned in southern Chahar, eastern Suiyuan and the Linfen area of Shansi, wiping out more than 43,000 enemy troops and recovering much territory. 
Between March 7 and May 29, units of the Central Plains and Eastern China Field Armies fought successive battles at Loyang and Sungho and in the sectors west and east of Nanyang, wiped out more than 56,000 enemy troops and thus crushed the enemy's defence system on the Central Plains and expanded and consolidated the Liberated Area there. 
Between March 11 and May 8, the Shantung Army of the Eastern China Field Army fought battles first on the western section of the Tsingtao-Tsinan Railway and then at Weihsien, wiping out more than 84,000 enemy troops. 
Thus, except for a few strong-points, such as Tsinan, Tsingtao, Linyi and Yenchow, which were held by the Kuomintang, Shantung Province was liberated. 
In March the Northern Kiangsu Army fought a successful battle at Yilin.
^fn8 For the ten major principles of operation, see "The Present Situation and Our Tasks", Section 3, pp. 160-63 of this volume.
^fn9 The Northwest Field Army led by Peng Teh-huai, Ho Lung, Hsi Chung-hsun and other comrades employed a main force of 2 columns and 2 brigades, totalling more than 25,000 men, in the fighting in northern Shensi in the summer of 1947. 
By the spring of 1948 the main force had increased to 5 columns, totalling more than 75,000 men. 
After having been steeled by a year's fighting and by the new type of ideological education movement in the army in the winter of 1947, the political consciousness of the broad masses of officers and soldiers and the combat effectiveness of the military units rose to unprecedented heights. 
This created the necessary conditions for the Northwest Field Army to turn to fighting on exterior lines in March 1948. 
On April 12, following its major victory at Yichuan, the Northwest Field Army launched a campaign in Hsifu (the area west of Sian and between the Chingshui and Weishui Rivers) and eastern Kansu, pushed forward into the broad area between the Chingshui and Weishui Rivers, cut the Sian-Lanchow highway, and on April 22 recovered Yenan.

^fn2 In October 1947 the reactionary Kuomintang government ordered the dissolution of the Democratic League. 
Under pressure from the Kuomintang reactionaries, some wavering members of the Democratic League dissolved it and ceased activities.
Other democratic parties, also being persecuted by the Kuomintang reactionaries, were then unable to function openly in the Kuomintang areas. 
In January 1948 Shen Chun-ju and other leaders of the Democratic League at a meeting in Hongkong decided to re-establish the League's leading body and resume the League's activities. 
In the same month Li Chi-shen and other members of the democratic wing of the Kuomintang established the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang in Hongkong. 
Both these bodies agreed with the position of the Communist Party of China about the current situation and issued declarations calling for unity with the Communist Party and other democratic parties, the overthrow of the Chiang Kai-shek dictatorship and opposition to USA armed intervention in China's internal affairs. 
The wavering members of the Democratic League also accepted these slogans at that time.
^fn3 The Kuomintang reactionaries held a bogus "National Assembly" in Nanking from March 29 to May 1, 1948, at which Chiang Kai-shek and Li Tsung-jen were "elected" "president" and "vice-president".
^fn4 In May 1948 the Shansi-Chahar-Hopei Liberated Area and the Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan Liberated Area were merged, and the Northern China Joint Administrative Council and the Northern China Military Area were established. 
In August of the same year the Northern China Joint Administrative Council was renamed the Northern China People's Government.
^fn5 Shihchiachuang in western Hopei Province was the first major city in northern China liberated by the People's Liberation Army.
^fn6 In December 1947 Pai Chung-hsi began attacking the Tapieh mountain area with 33 brigades.
^fn7 At that time the estimate was that the entire Kuomintang army would be wiped out in about five years. 
The estimated time was later reduced to about three and a half years.

^fn1 Issued on February 1948, this directive of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China summed up the experience of work in the land reform and Party consolidation in various Liberated Areas, laid down a series of policies and methods for the land reform and Party consolidation and stressed the correction of "Left" deviations which had occurred during the execution of these two tasks in certain areas.
^fn2 See the introductory note to "The Present Situation and Our Tasks", pp. 158-59 of this volume.
^fn3 This refers to the "Directive on Correcting Mistakes in the Determination of Class Status and on Uniting with the Middle Peasants" issued by the Shansi-Suiyuan Sub-Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on January 13, 1948. 
The directive is divided into five sections. 
The following are its main points:
(1) Because the criteria for class identification had not been well-defined, quite a few persons were wrongly classified as bankrupt landlords or rich peasants on the spontaneous demands of the peasants, and in particular, well-to-do middle peasants were wrongly classified as rich peasants. 
This had an adverse effect on the effort to unite with the middle peasants and was wrong.
(2) Proper measures were to be taken resolutely to persuade the peasants to correct these mistakes.
 Suitable restitution was to be made of property that had been taken.
(3) It was to be explained to the peasants and the cadres that the only criterion in class identification should be the relationship of exploitation.
 Mistakes in determining class status were to be corrected.
(4) The principle of relying on poor peasants and farm labourers and uniting with middle peasants had to be grasped.
 The middle peasants were to be enabled to have one-third of the members of the peasant representative conferences and of the leading bodies of the peasant associations, and consideration was to be given to their interests in taxation and in the land reform.
(5) Responsible cadres were to make a serious study of the Party's class policy for the rural areas. 
Mistakes that departed from the Party's policies concerning the middle peasants had to be corrected, they had to be corrected through the masses.
Simultaneously with the issuance of this five-point directive, the Shansi-Suiyuan Sub-Bureau issued the "Directive on the Protection of Industry and Commerce" to correct the deviations of encroaching on industry and commerce during the land reform) .
^fn4 This refers to the supply and marketing co-operatives.

^fn1 Loyang was an important stronghold of the Kuomintang troops in the western part of Honan Province. 
The People's Liberation Army first took Loyang on March 14, 1948, subsequently evacuated the city on its own initiative to facilitate the wiping out of the enemy's effective strength and recaptured Loyang on April 5, 1948.

^fn1 The Liaohsi-Shenyang campaign was a gigantic campaign fought by the Northeast People's Liberation Army in the western part of Liaoning Province and in the Shenyang-Changchun area between September 12 and November 2, 1948.
 On the eve of the campaign, the total strength of the Kuomintang forces in northeastern China consisted of 4 armies, made up of 14 corps, or 44 divisions.
 These forces had shortened their lines and dug themselves in at three sectors isolated from each other, Changchun, Shenyang and Chinchow.
 With the aim of completely wiping out the enemy troops in the Northeast and quickly liberating the whole of the Northeast,
 the People's Liberation Army in this region, supported by the broad masses of the local people, began the Liaobsi-Shenyang campaign in September 1948 with a main force of 12 columns, 1 artillery column and regional armed forces, altogether totalling 53 divisions or over 700,000 men.
 Chinchow, on the Peiping-Liaoning Railway, was the strategic link between northeastern and northern China. 
The enemy forces garrisoning the Chinchow sector consisted of 8 divisions, with more than 100,000 men under Fan Han-chieh, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Kuomintang's Northeast "Bandit Suppression" Headquarters.
 The capture of Chinchow was the key to the success of the Liaohsi-Shenyang campaign. 
Acting on the directives of Comrade Mao Tse-tung,
 the Northeast People's Liberation Army used 1 column and 7 independent divisions to continue the siege operations against Changchun; 6 columns, 1 artillery column and 1 tank battalion to surround and attack Chinchow and 2 columns,
 placed in the Tashan-Kaochiao sector southwest of Chinchow, along with 3 columns in the Heishan-Tahushan-Changwu sector to intercept any reinforcements the enemy might send from Chinhsi and Hulutao and from Shenyang to relieve Chinchow.
 The fighting in the Chinchow area started on September 12. 
Just as our army was mopping up the enemy in the outskirts of Chinchow after taking Ihsien, Chiang Kai-shek hurriedly flew to the Northeast to take personal charge of the operations and urgently summoned 5 enemy divisions from the Northern China "Bandit Suppression" Headquarters on the Peiping Liaoning Railway and 2 divisions from Shantung Province to join the 4 divisions in Chinhsi;
 all these 11 divisions began a furious attack on our positions at Tashan on October 10 but could not break through.
 Meanwhile, the Kuomintang 9th Army under Liao Yao-hsiang, with 11 divisions and 3 cavalry brigades, which had sallied out from Shenyang to rescue Chinchow, was intercepted by our army northeast of Heishan and Tahushan. 
Our army began the assault on Chinchow on October 14 and, after thirty-one hours of fierce fighting, completely wiped out the defending enemy forces,
 capturing Fan Han-chieh, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast "Bandit Suppression" Headquarters, Lu Chun-chuan, Commander of the 6th Army, and more than 100,000 men under their command.
 The liberation of Chinchow impelled part of the enemy forces at Changchun to revolt against the Kuomintang and the rest to surrender.
 The complete collapse of the Kuomintang troops in the Northeast then became a foregone conclusion.
 But Chiang Kai-shek, still dreaming of recapturing Chinchow and of reopening the line of communications between northeastern and northern China,
 gave strict orders to the army under Liao Yao-hsiang to continue its advance towards Chinchow. 
After taking Chinchow, the People's Liberation Army immediately swung back to the northeast and closed in on Liao's army from the north and south of Heishan and Tahushan.
 On October 26 the People's Liberation Army succeeded in surrounding the enemy in the Heishan-Tahushan-Hsinmin sector and, after stiff fighting lasting two days and one night, completely wiped them out, capturing army commander Liao Yao-hsiang, corps commanders Li Tao, Pai Feng-wu and Cheng Ting-chi, and more than 100,000 men.
 Our army vigorously followed up this victory and liberated Shenyang and Yingkow on November 2, wiping out over 149,000 enemy troops.
 The whole of the Northeast was thus liberated. 
A total of more than 470,000 enemy troops were wiped out in the campaign.
^fn2 See "A Circular on the Situation", Note 7, p. 226 of this volume.
^fn3 On November 1, 1948, the Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China classified all troops in the big strategic areas into field, regional and guerrilla forces in accordance with decisions made at the September meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee.
 The field forces were organized into field armies. 
A field army was composed of armies, an army of corps (originally called columns), a corps of divisions, and a division of regiments. 
In accordance with their locations, the field armies were designated the Northwest Field Army, Central Plains Field Army, Eastern China Field Army, Northeast field Army and Northern China Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
 The number of armies, corps and divisions in each field army differed according to the concrete conditions in each big strategic area.
 Later, the Northwest Field Army was renamed the First Field Army, comprising 2 armies; the Central Plains Field Army was renamed the Second Field Army, comprising 3 armies; the Eastern China Field Army was renamed the Third Field Army, comprising 4 armies; and the Northeast Field Army was renamed the Fourth Field Army, comprising 4 armies.
 The 3 armies making up the Northern China Field Army were placed under the direct command of the General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

^fn2 The defeat of the revolution in the south was the defeat of the Chinese Red Army's fifth campaign against the Kuomintang's "encirclement and suppression" and the withdrawal of our main force from the southern revolutionary bases in 1934; this was the consequence of the third "Left" deviationist line represented in the Party by Wang Ming.
^fn3 This refers to Kuomintang soldiers who were liberated through capture by the People's Liberation Army and joined its ranks after having been educated.
^fn4 The slogan of convening a political consultative conference was put forward by Comrade Mao Tse-tung. 
At his suggestion, one of the "May Day Slogans" for 1948 issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China stated, "All democratic parties, people's organizations and public personages should quickly call a political consultative conference to discuss and carry out the convening of a people's congress and the formation of a democratic coalition government." This slogan won an immediate warm response from the democratic parties, people's organizations and democrats without party affiliation in the Kuomintang areas. 
The political consultative conference was later renamed the New Political Consultative Conference and finally the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. 
See "Address to the Preparatory Meeting of the New Political Consultative Conference", Note 1, pp. 408-09 of this volume.
^fn5 This refers to "The Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Convening of Congresses and Conferences of the Party at Various Levels". 
The resolution made the following provisions for the broadening and building of regular democratic life within the Party: Party committees at various levels should regularly convene Party congresses and conferences at their respective levels, as required by the Party Constitution. 
These congresses and conferences should be vested with all the powers stipulated in the Party Constitution, and there must be no infringement. 
Adequate preparations should be made before meetings. 
Inner-Party controversies should be reported promptly and truthfully to the higher levels and important controversies must be reported to the Central Committee. 
The resolution also provided for strengthening the Party committee system and required that the rule that important questions must be decided collectively after discussion by the Party committee should be enforced by Party committees at all levels, that no decisions on important matters should be made by an individual and that neither collective leadership nor individual responsibility should be overemphasized to the neglect of the other.
^fn6 The Sixth National Labour Congress was held in Harbin in August 1948. 
The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the unified national organization of the Chinese working class, was re-established at the congress. 
The previous five National Labour Congresses were held in 1922, 1925, 1926, 1927 and 1929 respectively.
^fn7 The First National Women's Congress was held in March 1949 in Peiping. 
The All-China Federation of Democratic Women, the leading body for the organizations of the masses of women throughout the country, was founded at this congress. 
It was later renamed the National Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China.
^fn8 .The first session of the National Youth Congress was held in May 1949 in Peiping. 
The All-China Federation of Democratic Youth was founded at this session. 
It was later renamed the All-China Youth Federation.
^fn9 The New Democratic Youth League was founded in January 1949 in accordance with a decision by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. 
Its First National Congress was held in Peiping in April 1949. 
It was renamed the Communist Youth League at its Third National Congress in May 1957.

^fn1 The Huai-Hai campaign was a campaign of decisive importance fought by the People's Liberation Army over a large territory in Kiangsu, Shantung, Anhwei and Honan Provinces, centering on Hsuchow, and extending as far as Haichow in the east, Shangchiu in the west, Lincheng (now renamed Hsuehcheng) in the north and the Huai River in the south.
 The Kuomintang forces massed in this theatre of war consisted of 5 armies and the troops of three Pacification Zones --
 the 4 armies and the troops of three Pacification Zones under Liu Chih and Tu Yu-ming (respectively Commander and Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang's "Bandit Suppression" Headquarters at Hsuchow) and the army under Huang Wei, which was later dispatched there from central China as reinforcements.
 On the side of the People's Liberation Army, a force more than 600,000 strong took part in the campaign -- it included 16 columns from the Eastern China Field Army, 7 columns from the Central Plains Field Army and regional armed forces from the Eastern China Military Area, the Central Plains Military Area and the Hopei-Shantung-Honan Military Area (then a part of the Northern China Military Area).
 The campaign lasted sixty-five days, from November 6, 1948 to January 10, 1949; 22 corps, or 56 divisions, of the Kuomintang's crack forces, comprising 555,000 men, were completely wiped out (including 4 divisions which revolted and came over), and 2 armies under Liu Ju-ming and Li Yen-nien (reinforcements from Nanking) were repulsed.
 As a result of the campaign, those parts of the eastern China and Central Plains areas north of the Yangtse River were almost entirely liberated. 
The campaign took place in three stages.
 During the first stage, November 6-22, the Eastern China Field Army, in co-ordination with the Central Plains Field Army, surrounded and wiped out the army under Huang Po-tao in the Hsinanchen-Nienchuang sector east of Hsuchow, killing Huang Po-tao and liberating large territories on both sides of the Lunghai Railway east of Nienchuang, on both sides of the Hsuchow-Pengpu section of the Tientsin-Pukow Railway and to the west and north of Hsuchow.
 In the Taierhchuang-Tsaochuang sector, 3 divisions of the Kuomintang 3rd Pacification Zone, totalling over 23,000 men, revolted and came over to us.
 During the second stage, from November 23 to December 15, the Central Plains Field Army, in coordination with the main force of the Eastern China Field Army, surrounded and wiped out the army under Huang Wei at and around Shuangtuichi, southwest of Suhsien, capturing Huang Wei and Wu Shao-chou, the commander and deputy commander of the army; 1 division of this army revolted and came over to us.
 At the same time, our forces wiped out the army under Sun Yuan-liang which was fleeing west from Hsuchow.
 Only Sun Yuan-liang managed to escape. 
During the third stage, from January 6 to 10, 1949, the Eastern China Field Army, in co-ordination with the Central Plains Field Army, surrounded and annihilated in the Chinglungchi-Chenkuanchuang sector, northeast of Yungcheng, 2 Kuomintang armies which were fleeing westward from Hsuchow and were commanded respectively by Chiu Ching-chuan and Li Mi, under the personal command of Tu Yu-ming.
 Tu Yu-ming was captured, Chiu Ching-chuan was killed and Li Mi barely escaped. 
This marked the successful end of the great Huai-Hai campaign.
^fn2 "Capturing Tsinan and attacking the enemy's reinforcements" refers to the tactics employed by the People's Liberation Army during the Tsinan campaign in the middle of September 1948. 
Tsinan, a strategic position of the Kuomintang in Shantung Province, was garrisoned by over 110,000 men of the Kuomintang 2nd Pacification Zone.
 In addition, 23 brigades of the Kuomintang's main forces, with some 170,000 men, which were disposed in the Hsuchow area, were ready to move north to relieve Tsinan.
 Our Eastern China Field Army formed a group of 7 columns to assault the city and another group of 8 columns to strike at the enemy's reinforcements.
 The onslaught against Tsinan started on the evening of September 16, 1948. 
On September 24, after eight days and nights of continuous fighting, the enemy garrison was completely wiped out (1 corps revolted and came over to us), and Wang Yao-wu, Commander of the Kuomintang 2nd Pacification Zone, was captured. 
Our forces took Tsinan so rapidly that the enemy at Hsuchow did not dare to go north to its rescue.
^fn3 In fact, these 2 enemy divisions did not dare to come.

^fn1 The Sui-Ki campaign, also known as the Eastern Honan campaign, was fought by the People's Liberation Army in the sector comprising Kaifeng, Suihsien and Kihsien. 
The campaign started on June 17, 1948. 
On June 22 our army captured Kaifeng. 
To save his critical military situation, Chiang Kai-shek went to the front, took personal command and mustered 3 armies under Chiu Ching-chuan, Ou Shou-nien and Huang Po-tao to start an attack on Kaifeng from several directions. 
Six columns of our Eastern China Field Army, 2 columns of our Central Plains Field Army and our Kwangtung-Kwangsi Column surrounded the armies under Ou Shou-nien and Huang Po-tao in the Suihsien-Kihsien sector and, after nine days and nights of fierce fighting (June 27-July 6), they wiped out 2 divisions, or 6 brigades, of Ou Shou-nien's army and a part of Huang Po-tao's army, a total of over 90,000 men. 
Ou Shou-nien, army commander, and Shen Cheng-nien, Commander of the Reorganized 75th Division, were captured. 
For the Tsinan campaign, see "The Concept of Operations for the Huai-Hai Campaign", Note 2, p. 282 of this volume.
^fn2 The Chinchow, Changchun, Liaoshi and Shenyang campaigns in northeastern China, taken together, were called the Liaohsi-Shenyang campaign.

^fn1 The Peiping-Tientsin campaign, fought by the Northeast Field Army and two armies of the Northern China People's Liberation Army under the command of Lin Piao, Lo Jung-huan, Nieh Jung-chen and other comrades, began early in December 1948, immediately after the victorious conclusion of the Liaohsi-Shenyang campaign in the Northeast.
 Acting upon Comrade Mao Tse-tung's instructions, the Northeast Field Army, immediately after it had victoriously fulfilled its task of liberating the whole Northeast, swept south of the Great Wall and joined the armies of the People's Liberation Army in northern China in co-ordinated actions to encircle and wipe out the Kuomintang troops in northern China.
 Greatly alarmed by the victory of the People's Liberation Army in the Northeast, more than 600,000 Kuomintang troops under Fu Tso-yi, Commander-in-Chief of the Kuomintang's Northern China "Bandit Suppression" Headquarters, hurriedly shortened their lines of defence with the intention of fleeing south by sea or west to Suiyuan Province.
 Our army, moving with lightning speed, cut apart the enemy forces and surrounded them separately at five strong-points -- Peiping, Tientsin, Changchiakou, Hsinpao-an and Tangku -- thus blocking their escape routes to the south and west. 
On December 22, the enemy's main force at Hsinpao-an (the headquarters of his 35th Corps and 2 divisions) was surrounded and wiped out.
 On the 24th, Changchiakou was taken and a corps headquarters and 7 divisions of the enemy's 11th Army, over 54,000 men in all, were wiped out. 
On January 14, 1949, our troops surrounding Tientsin launched a general offensive against the city after Chen Chang-chieh, commander of the enemy garrison, refused to surrender.
 The city was liberated after twenty-nine hours' fierce fighting, the enemy garrison of over 130,000 men was wiped out and Chen Chang-chieh was captured.
 As a result, more than 200,000 enemy troops garrisoning Peiping were tightly surrounded by our troops and their fate was sealed. 
Owing to the efforts we made to win it over, the enemy's Peiping garrison, commanded by General Fu Tso-yi, accepted peaceful reorganization. 
On January 31, our troops entered Peiping, the city was proclaimed peacefully liberated and the Peiping-Tientsin campaign came to a victorious close.
 During this campaign, with the exception of the enemy garrison of over 50,000 men in Tangku, which fled by sea, over 520,000 Kuomintang troops were put out of action and reorganized by our army.
 In September 1949 the Kuomintang troops in Suiyuan Province declared by telegram that they had revolted and come over to the people and that they would accept reorganization.
^fn2 This means the area southwest of Nankow.
^fn3 In September 1948, to prevent the enemy forces in Ihsien, Chinchow, Chinhsi, Hsingcheng, Suichung, Shanhaikuan, Luanhsien and Changli, all points along the Peiping-Liaoning Railway, from shortening their lines and concentrating, the Northeast Field Army, then operating along that railway, adopted the method of first using part of its troops to encircle and cut apart the enemy units at these points and then wiping them out one by one.

^fn1 Ho Chi-feng and Chang Ke-hsia, Deputy Commanders of the Kuomintang's 3rd Pacification Zone, revolted against the Kuomintang in the Chiawang sector, northeast of Hsuchow, on November 8, 1948, during the first stage of the Huai-Hai campaign, and came over to the People's Liberation Army with 1 corps headquarters, 3 divisions and 1 regiment, totalling more than 20,000 men. 
Liao Yun-chou, Commander of the 110th Division of the Kuomintang's 85th Corps, revolted against the Kuomintang at Lochi, southwest of Suhsien, Anhwei Province, on November 27, 1948, during the second stage of the Huai-Hai campaign, and came over to the People's Liberation Army with his division headquarters and 2 full regiments, totalling 5,500 men. 
Sun Liang-cheng, Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang's 1st Pacification Zone and Commander of the 107th Corps, came over to the People's Liberation Army with his corps headquarters and 1 division, totalling 5,800 men, northwest of Suining, Kiangsu Province, on November 13, 1948, during the first stage of the Huai-Hai campaign. 
Chao Pi-kuang, Commander of the 150th Division of the Kuomintang's 44th Corps, came over to the People's Liberation Army with over 2,000 of his remaining troops in the Nienchuang sector, east of Hsuchow, Kiangsu Province, on November 18, 1948, during the first stage of the Huai-Hai campaign. 
Huang Tse-hua, Commander of the 23rd Division of the Kuomintang's 85th Corps, came over to the People's Liberation Army with his division headquarters and the remnants of 2 regiments at Shuangtuichi, northeast of Mengcheng, Anhwei Province, in December 1948, during the second stage of the Huai-Hai campaign.
^fn2 Changchun had been besieged by the Northeast People's Liberation Army since the winter of 1947. 
After the capture of Chinchow by our army, when all the enemy troops in the Northeast were in a shaky position, Cheng Tung-kuo, Kuomintang commander in Changchun and Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Kuomintang's Northeast "Bandit Suppression" Headquarters, led the army troops of the 1st Army and the officers and men of the New 7th Corps to surrender on October 19, 1948.
^fn3 After receiving this message, Tu Yu-ming, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Kuomintang's Hsuchow "Bandit Suppression" Headquarters, Chiu Ching-chuan, Commander of the Kuomintang's 2nd Army, and Li Mi, Commander of the Kuomintang's 13th Army, continued to resist desperately with the result that all their troops were wiped out by our army's powerful offensive. 
Tu Yu-ming was captured, Chiu Ching-chuan was killed and only Li Mi managed to escape.

^fn1 Following the Japanese surrender in 1945, the Kuomintang government divided the three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Kirin and Heilungkiang into nine provinces, Liaoning, Liaopei, Antung, Kirin, Hokiang, Sungkiang, Heilungkiang, Nunkiang and Hsingan. 
In 1949 our Northeast Administrative Commission redivided the area into five provinces, Liaotung, Liaohsi, Kirin, Heilungkiang and Sungkiang. 
Together with Jehol, these provinces were then referred to as the six northeastern provinces. 
In 1954 the Central People's Government Council merged the two provinces of Liaotung and Liaohsi into the one province of Liaoning and the two provinces of Sungkiang and Heilungkiang into the one province of Heilungkiang, while Kirin remained unchanged. 
In 1955 Jehol Province was abolished and the area previously under its jurisdiction was divided and incorporated into the provinces of Hopei and Liaoning and the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region.
^fn2 The dates of the taking of these key points were: Shihchiachuang, November 12, 1947; Yuncheng, December 28, 1947; Szepingkai, March 13, 1948; Loyang, first on March 14, 1948, and again on April 5, 1948; Yichuan, March 3, 1948; Paoki, April 26, 1948; Weihsien, April 27, 1948; Linfen, May 17, 1948; and Kaifeng, June 22, 1948. 
All these cities were fortified with many groups of blockhouses, and some had high, thick city walls; also, they all had auxiliary defence works, including multiple lines of trenches, barbed-wire entanglements and abatis. 
Our army at the time had neither planes nor tanks, and little or no artillery. 
In attacking and taking these cities, our army learned a complete set of tactics for taking strong fortifications. 
These tactics were:
(1) successive demolition -- using explosives to demolish the enemy's different defence installations in succession;
(2) tunnel operations -- secretly digging tunnels to and under the enemy's blockhouses or city walls, then blowing them up with explosives and following up with fierce attacks;
(3) approach trench operations -- digging trenches towards the enemy's fortifications, then approaching under cover to make sudden attacks;
(4) explosive package projectors -- shooting packages of explosives from missile-projectors or mortars to destroy the enemy's defences;
(5) "sharp knife" tactics -- concentrating manpower and firepower to effect a breakthrough and to cut up the enemy forces.
^fn3 The brigades mentioned here were those designated as brigades after the reorganization of the Kuomintang army, while the divisions were pre-reorganization divisions (which were practically the same as the reorganized brigades).

^fn1 The "Sino-USA Air Transport Agreement" between the Chiang Kai-shek government and USA imperialism was signed on December 20, 1946. 
In this agreement, Chiang Kai-shek completely sold out China's sovereignty over her air space. 
According to its provisions, USA aircraft were allowed to fly, load and unload or trans-ship anywhere within China, and the United States gained complete control of the country's air transport. 
USA aircraft were also accorded the right of "non-traffic stop", that is, of military landings on Chinese territory.
^fn2 The "Sino-USA bilateral agreement" was the so-called Sino-USA Economic Aid Agreement signed at Nanking on July 3, 1948 between the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek government and USA imperialism. 
It stipulated that USA imperialism was to have supreme authority to supervise and decide the financial and economic affairs of the Chiang Kai-shek government, that USA personnel exercising direct control in China were to enjoy "extraterritorial rights", and that USA imperialism could obtain from China any strategic materials it needed and was to be kept informed regularly by the Chiang Kai-shek government about their availability. 
In this agreement the Chiang Kai-shek government also guaranteed that USA goods could be dumped in China.
^fn3 Chia Pao-yu was a character in The Dream of the Red Chamber, an 18th century Chinese novel, and the Grand View Garden was his family garden.

^fn1 The eight terms for peace put forward by Comrade Mao Tse-tung in this statement became the basis for the peace negotiations held in April 1949 between the delegation of the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang government delegation headed by Chang Chih-chung. 
The Agreement on Internal Peace, drafted in the course of these negotiations, set forth concrete provisions for the eight peace terms.

^fn1 The delegation appointed by the reactionary Kuomintang government for the peace negotiations consisted of Shao Li-tse, Chang Chih-chung, Huang Shao-hung, Peng Chao-hsien and Chung Tien-hsin.
^fn2 On January 25, 1949, a spokesman for the Chinese Communist Party pointed out in his statement concerning the peace negotiations: "We have permitted the reactionary Nanking government to send a delegation for peace negotiations with us not because we recognize that government as still qualified to represent the Chinese people, but because it still has some remnants of the reactionary armed forces. 
If that government feels that it has completely forfeited the people's confidence and that the remnants of its reactionary armed forces are unable to resist the powerful People's Liberation Army and if that government is willing to accept the eight terms for peace proposed by the Chinese Communist Party, then it is of course preferable and beneficial to the cause of the liberation of the people to settle the matter by negotiations, so as to lessen the people's sufferings." As to the meeting place, the statement said, "It can be decided only after the complete liberation of Peiping and will probably be Peiping." As to the Nanking delegates, it stated, "Pen" Chao-hsien is one of the key figures of the Kuomintang CC clique, which has been most vehemently clamouring for war, and people consider him a war criminal; the Chinese Communist Party cannot receive such a delegate."
^fn3 Yasuji Okamura was one of the Japanese war criminals with the longest and blackest record of crimes of aggression against China. 
From 1925 to 1927, he was military adviser to Sun Chuan-fang, one of the Northern warlords. 
In 1928, as commanding officer of a Japanese infantry regiment, he took part in the war in which Japan attacked and seized Tsinan and was the butcher in the Tsinan Massacre. 
In 1932 he served as deputy chief of staff of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces which attacked and occupied Shanghai. 
In 1933 he represented the Japanese government at the signing of the "Tangku Agreement" with the traitorous Kuomintang government. 
From 1937 to 1945, he was successively the Commander of Japan's 11th Corps, Northern China Front Army and 6th Front Army and the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces in China. 
He enforced the extremely brutal policy of "burn all, kill all, loot all" in China. 
He was among the chief Japanese war criminals on the list published at Yenan in August 1945. 
During the People's War of Liberation he was Chiang Kai-shek's secret military adviser and planned Chiang's attacks on the Liberated Areas. 
In January 1949 he was declared not guilty and set free by the reactionary Kuomintang government and returned to Japan. 
In 1950 he accepted Chiang Kai-shek's offer of the post of senior training officer in the so-called Research Institute of Revolutionary Practice. 
Since 1955 he has organized ex-servicemen of the Japanese army and navy into the "League of Comrades in Arms" (later called the League of Retired Comrades in Arms) and has played a vigorous role in the reactionary activities to revive Japanese militarism.
^fn4 The "five terms" proposed by the reactionary Kuomintang government for the peace negotiations were put forward in Chiang Kai-shek's statement on New Year's Day, 1949. 
They were: 1. The peace negotiations "should not impair the country's independence and integrity". 
2. The peace negotiations "should help the rehabilitation of the people". 
3. "The sacred constitution should not be violated by my action and democratic constitutionalism should not be thereby undermined; the form of government of the Republic of China should be guaranteed and the legally constituted authority of the Republic of China should not be interrupted". 
4. "The armed forces should be definitely preserved". 
5. "The people should be allowed to continue their free way of life and maintain their present minimum standard of living". 
Comrade Mao Tse-tung promptly and sternly refuted these five terms. 
See "On the War Criminal's Suing for Peace", pp. 309-13 of this volume.
^fn5 The "eight terms" proposed by the Communist Party of China for the peace negotiations were put forward in Comrade Mao Tse-tung's statement of January 14, 1949, on the current situation.

^fn6 According to a Kuomintang Central News Agency dispatch dated January 27, 1949, the Ministry of National Defence of the Nanking government stated: "In northern China, in order to shorten the war, secure peace and thereby preserve the foundations of the ancient capital, Peiping, and its cultural objects and historic monuments, Commander-in-Chief Fu Tso-yi issued a proclamation on January 22 to the effect that hostilities were to cease as from 10 o'clock that day. 
On orders from General Headquarters, the bulk of our troops in Peiping have withdrawn from the city limits to certain designated areas." It further stated, "Cessation of hostilities will be effected also in Suiyuan and Tatung."

^fn1 The Second and Third Field Armies had planned to advance the date of crossing the Yangtse River from April to March 1949. 
The crossing was postponed to late April because of the peace negotiations with the reactionary Kuomintang government.
^fn2 In order to meet the needs of the Huai-Hai campaign, the Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China decided on November 16, 1948 to form a General Front Committee consisting of Comrades Liu Po-cheng, Chen Yi, Teng Hsiao-ping, Su Yu and Tan Chen-lin, with Comrade Teng Hsiao-ping as secretary, to assume unified leadership of the Central Plains Field Army and the Eastern China Field Army and to exercise command over military affairs and operations on the Huai-Hai front.

^fn1 Taking advantage of the extremely unfavourable situation then facing Chiang Kai-shek, Pai Chung-hsi, Commander-in-Chief of the Central China "Bandit Suppression" Headquarters of the Kuomintang, proposed a "peaceful settlement" of the civil war to Chiang, with the purpose of forcing him to step down and of raising the position of the Kwangsi clique to which Pai belonged. 
Under Pai Chung-hsi's direction the bogus Hupeh Provincial Council sent a telegram to Chiang Kai-shek, warning him that "if the disaster of war continues to spread and no attempt is made to change the course immediately, both the state and the people will be ruined", and advising him to "follow the normal course of political settlement and seek ways to resume peace negotiations".
^fn2 The request for intervention was rejected by the governments of the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union. 
In its aide-mémoire to the Kuomintang government on January 12, the USA government explained that the United States had rejected the request of the Kuomintang government because "it is not believed that any useful purpose would be served". 
This meant that the USA government was already aware that it could no longer avert the doom of the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek regime it had fostered.
^fn3 On February 6 and 7, 1949, Sun Fo, president of the bogus Executive Yuan of the Kuomintang government, made two statements at Canton opposing Li Tsung-jen's statement about accepting the eight terms for peace put forward by the Communist Party of China as the basis for negotiations. 
He said that "the Government has begun functioning in Canton where it has moved, and we should make a critical review of our past". 
He also said that "the term on the punishment of war criminals proposed by the Communists is absolutely unacceptable".
^fn4 Lines from an ode by the 14th century Chinese poet, Sadul, of the Yuan Dynasty. 
The first half of the ode reads:
From the ramparts of the Stone City
One sees the sky brooding low over the land of Wu and Chu,
With nothing between to meet the eye.
Pointing to strategic points famous in the Six Dynasties,
Only the green hills stand like walls.
Where army flags blotted the sun
And masts of war vessels touched the clouds
Snow-white skeletons lie scattered.
North and south of the River
How many warriors died!
The "Stone City" was an ancient name for Nanking.
^fn5 In his written statement on the "Development of Peace and War", Teng Wen-yi set forth the following "four points": (1) "The Government wants peace"; (2) "The Chinese Communist Party wants war"; (3) "The local peace at Peiping has become a hoax"; (4) "We will stop at no sacrifices in order to fight the Communists to the bitter end".
^fn6 After the liberation of Tientsin and Peiping, only a few isolated strong-points in northern China remained in the hands of the Kuomintang forces. 
They included Taiyuan, Tatung, Hsinhsiang, Anyang and Kueisui. 
The enemy at Taiyuan was completely wiped out on April 24, 1949. 
The enemy at Tatung submitted to peaceful reorganization on May 1. 
The enemy at Hsinhsiang surrendered on May 5. 
The enemy at Anyang was wiped out on May 6. 
Kueisui was peacefully liberated on September 19.

^fn1 On September 19, 1949, Tung Chi-wu, Kuomintang governor of Suiyuan Province, and Sun Lan-feng, Kuomintang army commander, revolted and came over with more than forty thousand men. 
The regrouping of these units began on February 21, 1950, under the leadership of the Suiyuan Military Command of the People's Liberation Army. 
They were reorganized into the People's Liberation Army on April 10.

The Manifesto of the Kuomintang's First National Congress, in which the Kuomintang and the Communist Party co-operated, was published on January 23, 1924 and gave the following interpretation to this slogan: "Private industries, whether of Chinese or of foreign nationals, which are either of a monopolistic nature or are beyond the capacity of private individuals to develop, such as banking, railways, and navigation, shall be undertaken by the state, so that privately owned capital shall not control the economic life of the people."
^fn3 Concerning peace negotiations with the reactionary Nanking Kuomintang government, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China made the following decisions on March 26, 1949:
(1) Time for the negotiations to begin, April l;
(2) Place for the negotiations, Peiping;
(3) Chou En-lai, Lin Po-chu, Lin Piao, Yeh Chien-ying and Li Wei-han are appointed as delegates (on April 1, the Central Committee decided to add Nieh Jung-chen to the list of delegates), with Chou En-lai as chief delegate, to negotiate with the Nanking delegation on the basis of Chairman Mao Tse-tung's Statement on the Present Situation made on January 14 and the eight terms set forth therein;

^fn1 On April 1, 1949, the Kuomintang government delegation headed by Chang Chih-chung arrived in Peiping to negotiate peace with the delegation of the Communist Party of China. 
An Agreement on Internal Peace was drafted after a half month of negotiations. 
The agreement (final amended version) was handed to the Nanking government delegation by the delegation of the Communist Party of China on April 15 and was rejected by the Nanking government on April 20.
 The full text of the agreement (final amended version) is as follows:
In the 35th year of the Republic of China, the National Government at Nanking, with the aid of the Government of the United States of America, defied the will of the people, wrecked the truce agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and, on the pretext of opposing the Communist Party of China, launched a country-wide civil war against the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. 
This war has lasted two years and nine and a half months.
 It has brought untold disaster to the people throughout the country. 
The country has suffered tremendous losses of financial and material resources, and its sovereignty has been further infringed. 
The people of the whole country have always expressed dissatisfaction with the National Government at Nanking for its violation of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary Three People's Principles and of his correct policies of alliance with Russia, co-operation with the Communist Party and assistance to the peasants and workers, and for its violation of his revolutionary testament.
 In particular, the whole people have voiced their opposition to the launching of the present unprecedented large-scale civil war by the National Government at Nanking and to the erroneous political, military, financial, economic, cultural and foreign policies and measures which that government has adopted in its pursuit of the civil war.
 The National Government at Nanking has completely forfeited the confidence of the entire people. 
In the present civil war its troops have already been defeated by the People's Liberation Army led by the Communist Party of China and commanded by the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission. 
Finding itself in this situation, the National Government at Nanking proposed to the Communist Party of China on January 1 of the 38th year of the Republic of China that negotiations should be held for the cessation of the civil war and the restoration of peace.
 On January 14 of the same year, the Communist Party of China issued a statement agreeing to this proposal of the Kuomintang government at Nanking and putting forward eight terms as the basis for the peace negotiations between the two sides. 
These terms are as follows: punish the war criminals; abolish the bogus constitution; abolish the bogus "constituted authority";
 reorganize all reactionary troops on democratic principles; confiscate bureaucrat-capital; reform the land system; abrogate treasonable treaties; convene a New Political Consultative Conference without the participation of reactionary elements and form a democratic coalition government to take over all the power and authority of the reactionary Nanking Kuomintang government and of its subordinate governments at all levels. 
These eight basic terms were agreed to by the National Government at Nanking.
 Thereupon, the Communist Party of China and the National Government at Nanking appointed their respective delegations, fully empowered to conduct negotiations and to sign an agreement. 
The delegates of both parties met in Peiping, have affirmed first of all that the National Government at Nanking should bear the full responsibility for the present civil war and for all its erroneous policies and have agreed to conclude this agreement.

^zc1 Item 1. 
All war criminals, no matter who they are, may be cleared of the charge of being war criminals and treated with leniency, provided they show by actual deeds that they are really sincere in distinguishing right from wrong and are determined to make a clean break with their past, thus facilitating the progress of the cause of the Chinese people's liberation and the peaceful settlement of the internal problem.

^fn1 Pao chia was the administrative system by which the Kuomintang reactionary clique enforced its fascist rule at the primary level. 
On August 1, 1932, Chiang Kai-shek promulgated the "Regulations for the Organization of Pao and Chia and for a Population Census in the Counties" covering the provinces of Honan, Hupeh and Anhwei. 
The "Regulations" provided that "the pao and chia are to be organized on the basis of households; there is to be a head of each household, of each chia, which is made up of ten households, and of each pao, which is made up of ten chia". 
Neighbours were required to watch and report each other's activities to the authorities, and all were punishable when one was found guilty; various counter-revolutionary measures for exacting compulsory labour were also laid down. 
On November 7, 1934, the Kuomintang government officially announced that this system of fascist rule was to be established in all the provinces and municipalities under its rule.
^c152
^fn1 On April 20-21 1949, while the People's Liberation Army was fighting its way across the Yangtse, the Amethyst and three other British warships intruded into the river, an inland waterway of China, and, together with Kuomintang warships, fired on our army, causing 252 casualties. 
The People's Liberation Army returned the fire; the Amethyst was disabled and forced to anchor near Chinkiang; the other three British warships escaped. 
The British authorities requested that the Amethyst should be allowed to leave, and its captain, acting on the orders of Brind, Commander-in-Chief of the British Far Eastern Fleet, conducted negotiations with the representative of our army. 
During these negotiations, the British side consistently prevaricated and refused to admit its criminal acts of aggression. 
While the negotiations were continuing, on the night of July 30, the Amethyst forced her way alongside a passenger ship, the Liberated Chiangling, which was going downstream off Chinkiang, and escaped by using that ship as a shield. 
When our army signalled a warning to the Amethyst to stop, she opened fire, collided with and sank a number of junks and escaped from the Yangtse River.
^fn2 On April 26, 1949, speaking in the British House of Commons, Churchill, the chieftain of the British Conservative Party, slandered as an "atrocious outrage" the action taken by the Chinese People's Liberation Army in counter-attacking the British warships which had fired on our army, and demanded that the British government "get in Chinese waters one aircraft carrier, if not two, capable of …effective power of retaliation".
^fn3 On April 26, 1949, British Prime Minister Attlee declared in the House of Commons that British naval vessels had been within their rights in going up the Yangtse on their "peaceful missions", because they had the permission of the Kuomintang government of China. 
At the same time, when speaking about the negotiations which the British representative was holding with the representative of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Attlee lied, saying that the Chinese People's Liberation Army "would be prepared to allow the ship [the Amethyst] to proceed to Nanking but only on condition that she should assist the People's Liberation Army to cross the Yangtse".
^fn4 It was the British government which in February 1948 gave the Kuomintang the heavy cruiser Chungking, the largest cruiser in the Kuomintang navy. 
On February 25, 1949, the officers and men of the cruiser revolted, renounced their allegiance to the reactionary Kuomintang government and joined the Chinese People's Navy. 
On March 19 the USA imperialists and the Kuomintang bandits sent heavy bombers and sank the Chungking off Hulutao, in Liaotung Gulf in northeastern China.

^fn1 The meeting was held at Peiping from June 15 to 19, 1949. 
It was attended by 134 representatives from twenty-three organizations and groups, including the Communist Party of China, the various democratic parties, the people's organizations, democratic personages in all walks of life, the minority nationalities of the country and the overseas Chinese. 
It adopted the "Organic Rules of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference" and the "Provisions Regarding the Organizations and Groups Participating in the New Political Consultative Conference and the Size of Their Delegations" and elected a Standing Committee headed by Chairman Mao Tse-tung. 
The Conference was called the New Political Consultative Conference to distinguish it from the Political Consultative Conference which had opened at Chungking on January 10, 1946. 
Its name was changed to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference at its first plenary session on September 21, 1949.

^fn1 Also known as the world of Great Harmony. 
It refers to a society based on public ownership, free from class exploitation and oppression -- a lofty ideal long cherished by the Chinese people. 
Here the realm of Great Harmony means communist society.
^fn2 See V. 1. Lenin, "Left-Wing" Communism, an Infantile Disorder, Chapter 2. 
Lenin said: "for nearly half a century -- approximately from the 'forties to the 'nineties -- advanced thinkers in Russia, under the oppression of an unparalleled, savage and reactionary tsardom, eagerly sought for the correct revolutionary theory and followed each and every 'last word' in Europe and America in this sphere with astonishing diligence and thoroughness. 
Russia achieved Marxism, the only correct revolutionary theory, veritably through suffering, by half a century of unprecedented torment and sacrifice, of unprecedented revolutionary heroism, incredible energy, devoted searching, study, testing in practice, disappointment, verification and comparison with European experience."
^fn3 Faced with the opposition of the Chinese people to her traffic in opium, Britain sent forces in 1840-42 to invade Kwangtung and other coastal regions of China under the pretext of protecting trade. 
The troops in Kwangtung, led by Lin Tse-hsu, fought a war of resistance.
^fn4 Hung Hsiu-chuan (1814-64), who was born in Kwangtung, was the leader of a peasant revolutionary war in the middle of the 19th century. 
In 1851 he led a mass uprising in Kwangsi and proclaimed the establishment of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, which held many provinces and fought the Ching Dynasty for fourteen years. 
In 1864 this revolutionary war failed and Hung Hsiu-chuan committed suicide by poison.
^fn5 Kang Yu-wei (1858-1927), of Nanhai County, Kwangtung Province. 
In 1895, after China had been defeated by Japanese imperialism in the previous year, he led thirteen hundred candidates for the third grade in the imperial examinations at Peking in submitting a "ten thousand word memorial" to Emperor Kuang Hsu, asking for "constitutional reform and modernization" and asking that the autocratic monarchy be changed into a constitutional monarchy. 
In 1898, in an attempt to introduce reforms, the emperor promoted Kang Yu-wei together with Tan Sze-tung, Liang Chi-chao and others to key posts in the government. 
Later, the Empress Dowager Tzu Hsi, representing the die-hards, again took power and the reform movement failed. 
Kang Yu-wei and Liang Chi-chao fled abroad and formed the Protect-the-Emperor Party, which became a reactionary political faction in opposition to the bourgeois and petty bourgeois revolutionaries represented by Sun Yat-sen. 
Among Kang's works were Forgeries in the Classics of the Confucian Canon, Confucius as a Reformer, and Ta Tung Shu or the Book of Great Harmony.
^fn6 Yen Fu (1853-1921), of Foochow, Fukien Province, studied at a naval academy in Britain. 
After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, he advocated constitutional monarchy and reforms to modernize China. 
His translations of T. H. Huxley's Evolution and Ethics, Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations, J. S. Mill's System of Logic, Montesquieu's L'Esprit des Lois, and other works were vehicles for the spread of European bourgeois thought in China.
^fn7 A system of examinations adopted by China's autocratic dynasties. 
It was a method used by the feudal ruling class for selecting personnel to govern the people and also for enticing the intellectuals. 
The system, dating from the 7th century, persisted into the early 20th century.
^fn8 The Revolution of 1911 overthrew the autocratic regime of the Ching Dynasty. 
On October 10 of that year, a section of the New Army, at the urging of the revolutionary societies of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, staged an uprising in Wuchang. 
This was followed by uprisings in other provinces, and very soon the rule of the Ching Dynasty crumbled. 
On January 1, 1912, the Provisional Government of the Republic of China was set up in Nanking, and Sun Yat-sen was elected Provisional President. 
The revolution achieved victory through the alliance of the bourgeoisie, peasants, workers and urban petty bourgeoisie. 
But because the group which led the revolution was compromising in nature, failed to bring real benefits to the peasants and yielded to the pressure of imperialism and the feudal forces, state power fell into the hands of the Northern warlord Yuan Shih-kai, and the revolution failed.

^fn10 For the relation between the socialization of agriculture and the industrialization of the country, see On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation (Sections 7 and 8), a report made by Comrade Mao Tse-tung on July 31, 1955 at the Conference of the Secretaries of the Provincial, Municipal and Autonomous Region Committees of the Chinese Communist Party. 
In this report Comrade Mao Tse-tung, on the basis of Soviet experience and our own country's practice, greatly developed the thesis that socialization of agriculture should proceed in step with socialist industrialization.

^fn1 The USA White Paper, United States Relations with China, was published by the USA State Department on August 5, 1949. 
Acheson's Letter of Transmittal to Truman was dated July 30, 1949. 
The main body of the White Paper, divided into eight chapters, deals with Sino-USA relations in the period from 1844, when the United States forced China to sign the "Treaty of Wanghia", to 1949, when victory was basically won throughout the country in the Chinese people's revolution. 
The White Paper goes into particular detail about how, in the five years from the last part of the War of Resistance Against Japan to 1949, the United States pursued a policy of support for Chiang Kai-shek and of anti-communism, opposed the Chinese people by every possible means and finally met with defeat. 
The White Paper and Acheson's Letter of Transmittal are full of distortions, omissions and fabrications, and also of venomous slanders and deep hatred against the Chinese people. 
In the quarrel within the USA reactionary camp over its policy towards China, imperialists like Truman and Acheson were compelled to reveal publicly through the White Paper some of the truth about their counter-revolutionary activities in an attempt to convince their opponents. 
Thus, in its objective effect, the White Paper became a confession by USA imperialism of its crimes of aggression against China.
^fn2 See "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship", Note 3, p. 42, of this volume.
^fn3 From 1856 to 1860 Britain and France jointly carried on a war of aggression against China, with the United States and tsarist Russia supporting them from the side-lines. 
The government of the Ching Dynasty was then devoting all its energy to suppressing the peasant revolution of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and adopted a policy of passive resistance towards the foreign aggressors. 
The Anglo-French allied forces occupied such major cities as Canton, Tientsin and Peking, plundered and burned down Yuan Ming Yuan Palace in Peking and forced the Ching government to conclude the "Treaty of Tientsin" and the "Treaty of Peking". 
The main provisions of these treaties included the opening as treaty ports of Tientsin, Newchwang, Tengchow, Taiwan, Tanshui, Chaochow, Chiungchow, Nanking, Chinkiang, Kiukiang and Hankow and the granting to foreigners of the special privileges of travel and missionary activities in China's interior and of inland navigation. 
From then on foreign forces of aggression extended over all China's coastal provinces and penetrated deep into the hinterland.
^fn4 In 1884-85 the French aggressors invaded Vietnam and the Chinese provinces of Kwangsi, Fukien, Taiwan and Chekiang. 
Chinese troops resisted vigorously and won a series of victories. 
Notwithstanding the victories in the war, the corrupt Ching government signed the humiliating "Treaty of Tientsin", which recognized the occupation of Vietnam by the French and permitted their forces of aggression to penetrate southern China.
^fn5 The Sino-Japanese War of 1894. 
The war broke out as a result of Japan's aggression against Korea and her provocations to the Chinese land and naval forces. 
In this war the Chinese forces put up a heroic fight, but China suffered defeat owing to the corruption of the Ching government and its lack of preparation for resistance. 
As a result, the Ching government concluded the shameful "Treaty of Shimonoseki" with Japan, under which it ceded Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, paid war reparations of 200 million taels of silver, permitted the Japanese to set up factories in China, opened Shasi, Chungking, Soochow and Hangchow as treaty ports and recognized Japan's domination over Korea.
^fn6 In 1900 eight imperialist powers, Britain, Prance, Japan, tsarist Russia, Germany, the United States, Italy and Austria, sent a joint force to attack China in an attempt to suppress the Yi Ho Tuan Uprising of the Chinese people against aggression. 
The Chinese people resisted heroically. 
The allied forces of the eight powers captured Taku and occupied Tientsin and Peking. 
In 1901 the Ching government concluded a treaty with the eight imperialist countries; its main provisions were that China had to pay those countries the enormous sum of 450 million taels of silver as war reparations and grant them the special privilege of stationing troops in Peking and in the area from Peking to Tientsin to Shanhaikuan.
^fn7 This was the imperialist war fought between Japan and tsarist Russia in 1904-05 to grab China's Northeast and Korea. 
As the war was fought mainly in the area of Fengtien (now Shenyang) and Liaoyang and around the port of Lushun in China's Northeast, it caused enormous losses to the Chinese people. 
As a result of the war tsarist Russia was defeated and supplanted by Japanese imperialism in the dominant role in China's Northeast. 
Under the peace treaty (the Treaty of Portsmouth) concluded at the end of this war tsarist Russia also recognized Japan's exclusive control over Korea.
^fn8 Hu Shih, who was formerly a university professor, university president and ambassador of the Kuomintang government to the United States, is a well-known apologist for USA imperialism among Chinese bourgeois intellectuals. 
Fu Sze-nien and Chien Mu, also university professors, were scholars serving the reactionary Kuomintang government.

^fn1 John Leighton Stuart, who was born in China in 1876, was always a loyal agent of USA cultural aggression in China. 
He started missionary work in China in 1905 and in 1919 became president of Yenching University, which was established by the United States in Peking. 
On July 11, 1946, he was appointed USA ambassador to China. 
He actively supported the Kuomintang reactionaries in prosecuting the civil war and carried out various political intrigues against the Chinese people. 
On August 2, 1949, because all the efforts of USA imperialism to obstruct the victory of the Chinese people's revolution had completely failed, Leighton Stuart had to leave China quietly.
^fn2 Following the Japanese surrender in 1945, the armed forces of the United States, with the purpose of aggression against China's territory and sovereignty and of interference in her domestic affairs, landed in China and stationed themselves at Peiping, Shanghai, Nanking, Tientsin, Tangshan, Kaiping, Chinwangtao, Chinghai, Tsingtao and other places. 
In addition, they repeatedly invaded the Liberated Areas. 
On July 29, 1946, USA troops in Tientsin, in co-ordination with Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, assaulted the town of Anping, Hsiangho County, Hopei Province; this is the Anping Incident referred to in the text. 
On March 1, 1947, USA troops made a military reconnaissance of the position of the People's Liberation Army at Hohsipao, situated between Changchun and Chintai in northeastern China. 
On June 16, 1946, USA troops at Tangshan, Hopei Province, raided Sungchiaying and other places; in July they raided Sanho Village, Luanhsien County, and Hsihonan Village, Changli County, both near Tangshan. 
Of the numerous attacks on the Eastern Shantung Peninsula, the most widely-known were two, one by USA aircraft and warships on Langnuankou and Hsiaoli Island, Mouping County, on August 28, 1947, and the other by USA forces on Wanglintao Village, north of Chimo County, on December 25, 1947 in co-ordination with Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops. 
In all these cases in which the USA forces committed acts of aggression by invading the Liberated Areas, the Chinese People's Liberation Army or the local people's armed forces took just action in self-defence.
^fn3 Claire Lee Chennault was at one time USA adviser to the Kuomintang government's air force. 
After the Japanese surrender, he organized a group of the USA 14th Air Force personnel into an air transport corps to help the Kuomintang fight the civil war. 
His air transport corps took a direct part in the criminal reconnoitring and bombing of the Liberated Areas.

^fn5 On June 5, 1947, USA Secretary of State George C. 
Marshall made a speech at Harvard University, putting forward a plan for so-called USA "aid" to rehabilitate Europe. 
The "European Recovery Programme" subsequently drawn up by the USA government on the basis of the speech was known as the "Marshall Plan".
^fn6 Chiang Tai Kung lived in the Chou Dynasty. 
According to a legend, he once fished in the Weishui River, holding a rod without hook or bait three feet above the water, and saying, "The fish that is destined to be caught will come up." (From Stories About King Wu's Expedition Against the Yin Dynasty.)
^fn7 "Food handed out in contempt" refers to alms handed out as an insult. 
It is an allusion to a story in the Book of Rites, which tells of a hungry man in the State of Chi, who would rather starve to death than accept food given him insultingly.
^fn8 Wen Yi-to (1899-1946), famed Chinese poet, scholar and university professor. 
In 1943 he began to take an active part in the struggle for democracy out of bitter hatred for the reaction and corruption of the Chiang Kai-shek government. 
After the War of Resistance Against Japan, he vigorously opposed the Kuomintang's conspiracy with USA imperialism to start civil war against the people. 
On July 15, 1946, he was assassinated in Kunming by Kuomintang thugs.
^fn9 Chu Tse-ching (1898-1948) Chinese man of letters and university professor. 
After the War of Resistance, he actively supported the student movement against the Chiang Kai-shek regime. 
In June 1948 he signed a declaration protesting against the revival of Japanese militarism, which was being fostered by the United States, and rejecting "USA relief" flour. 
He was then living in great poverty. 
He died in Peiping on August l2, 1948, from poverty and illness, but even on his death-bed he enjoined his family not to buy the USA flour rationed by the Kuomintang government.
^fn10 Han Yu (768-824) was a famous writer of the Tang Dynasty. 
"Eulogy of Po Yi" was a prose piece written by him. 
Po Yi, who lived towards the end of the Yin Dynasty, opposed the expedition of King Wu of Chou against the House of Yin. 
After the downfall of the House of Yin, he fled to the Shouyang Mountain and starved to death rather than eat of Chou grain.

^fn2 George Washington (1732-99), Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826) and Abraham Lincoln (1809-65) were well-known bourgeois statesmen in the early days of the United States. 
Washington was the commander-in-chief of the revolutionary army of the colonies during the American War of Independence (1775-83) and the first president of the United States. 
Jefferson drafted the American Declaration of Independence and became president of the United States. 
Lincoln advocated the abolition of Negro slavery in the United States and during his presidency led the war against the slave-owners of the southern states (1861-65); he issued the "Emancipation Proclamation" in 1862.

^fn1 "Extraterritoriality" here refers to consular jurisdiction. 
It was one of the special privileges for aggression which the imperialists wrested from China. 
Under the so-called consular jurisdiction, nationals of imperialist countries residing in China were not subject to the jurisdiction of Chinese law; when they committed crimes or became defendants in civil lawsuits, they could be tried only in their respective countries' consular courts in China, and the Chinese government could not intervene.
^fn2 The "Treaty of Wanghia" was the first unequal treaty signed as a result of USA aggression against China. 
The United States, taking advantage of China's defeat in the Opium War, compelled the Ching Dynasty to sign this treaty, also called the "Sino-American Treaty on the Opening of Five Ports for Trade", in Wanghia Village near Macao in July 1844. 
Its thirty-four articles stipulated that whatever rights and privileges, including consular jurisdiction, were gained by Britain through the Treaty of Nanking and its annexes would also accrue to the United States.

^fn5 William Pierson, a corporal, and other USA marines raped Shen Chung, a girl student of Peking University, in Peiping on December 24, 1946. 
This aroused the great indignation of the people throughout the country against the atrocities of the USA forces. 
In January 1947, brushing aside the people's protests, the Kuomintang government handed over the chief criminal, Pierson, to the Americans to be dealt with at their discretion. 
In August the USA Navy Department set this criminal free with a verdict of "not guilty".

^fn2 In their struggle for liberation in 1921-24 the Mongolian people, under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, drove out the Russian Whiteguard bandit troops and the armed forces of the Northern warlords of China, both of which were backed by Japanese imperialism, overthrew Mongolian feudal rule and founded the Mongolian People's Republic.
^fn3 T. R. Malthus (1766-1834), Anglican clergyman and reactionary economist. 
In his Essay on Population (1798), he wrote that "population unchecked …increases in geometrical ratio …[while] the means of subsistence …could not possibly be made to increase faster than in an arithmetical ratio". 
Basing himself on this arbitrary assumption, he came to the conclusion that all poverty and all evils in human society are permanent phenomena of nature. 
According to him, the only ways to solve the problem of poverty of the working people were to shorten their life-span, reduce the population or stop its increase. 
He regarded famine, pestilence and war as means to cut down population.
^fn4 The War of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was a peasant revolutionary war waged against the feudal rule and national oppression of the Ching Dynasty in the middle of the 19th century. 
Hung Hsiu-chuan, Yang Hsiu-ching and others, the leaders of this revolution, staged an uprising in Kwangsi in January 1851 and proclaimed the founding of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. 
In 1852 the peasant army proceeded northward from Kwangsi and marched through Hunan, Hupeh, Kiangsi and Anhwei and in 1853 it captured Nanking, the main city on the lower Yangtse. 
Part of its forces then continued the drive north and pushed to the vicinity of Tientsin, a major city in northern China. 
Because the Taiping army failed to build stable base areas in the places it occupied and also because, after establishing its capital in Nanking, the leading group in the army committed many political and military errors, it could not withstand the joint attack of the counter-revolutionary troops of the Ching government and the aggressors, Britain, the United States and France, and suffered defeat in 1864.
^fn5 See Manifesto of the Communist Party, Chapter 1, "Bourgeois and Proletarians". 
The bourgeoisie "compels all nations, on pain of extinction, to adopt the bourgeois mode of production; it compels them to introduce what it calls civilization into their midst, ie, to become bourgeois themselves. 
In one word, it creates a world after its own image".
^fn6 In October 1934 the First, Third and Fifth Army Groups of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army (that is, the First Front Army of the Red Army, also known as the Central Red Army) set out from Changting and Ninghua in western Fukien and from Juichin, Yutu and other places in southern Kiangsi and started a major strategic movement. 
In traversing the eleven provinces of Fukien, Kiangsi, Kwangtung, Hunan, Kwangsi, Kweichow, Szechuan, Yunnan, Sikang, Kansu and Shensi, crossing perpetually snow-capped mountains and trackless grasslands, sustaining untold hardships and frustrating the enemy's repeated encirclements, pursuits, obstructions and interceptions, the Red Army covered 25,000 li (12,500 kilometres) on this march and finally arrived triumphantly at the revolutionary base area in northern Shensi in October 1935.

^fn3 Beginning from the winter of 1950, the new liberated areas, one after another, unfolded a large-scale agrarian reform movement. 
By the winter of 1952 agrarian reform was basically completed, except in some minority nationality areas. 
In the old and new liberated areas throughout the country, about 300 million landless or land deficient peasants received some 700 million mou of land.
^fn4 Before the election and convocation of the local people's congresses at all levels, conferences of people from all circles were convened, in accordance with the stipulations of the Common Programme of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference of 1949, to exercise the functions and powers of the people's congresses step by step.
^c167
^fn1 At that time, the country was divided into six greater administrative areas, namely, the Northeast, North China, East China, the Central South, the Southwest and the Northwest, with a bureau in each representing the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. 
Each of the five areas except North China had its administrative organ. 
That of the Northeast was called the people's government, while in the other four it was known as the military and administrative commission. 
In November 1952 these were all renamed administrative councils, and one such council was also established in North China. 
In 1954 all the administrative councils were abolished.
^fn2 The consultative committees of conferences of people from all circles at the provincial and municipal level were elected by conferences of people from all circles at the same level. 
When the latter were not in session, the former were charged with the function of assisting the people's governments in carrying out the conferences' resolutions.
^fn3 This refers to the "Draft Agrarian Reform Law of the People's Republic of China". 
The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party presented the draft to the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on June 14, 1950 for discussion. 
After it had been discussed and endorsed by the session, the Central People's Government Council approved the draft. 
On June 30 of the same year, Mao Tsetung, Chairman of the Central People's Government, promulgated the "Agrarian Reform Law of the People's Republic of China".
^c171
^fn1 Before liberation the peasants who rented land from the landlords had to pay a considerable sum of security money in advance for their tenancy. 
During the agrarian reform the peasants demanded reimbursement of this money by the landlords, and this was known as the return of security money. 
Those landlords who were also running industrial and commercial enterprises or who were unable to repay the sum all at once were allowed to return it in instalments.
^fn2 In the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, there are three layers to be swept clean, the outer, middle and inner layers. 
To sweep clean the "outer layer" refers to uncovering counter-revolutionaries lying low in society at large; to sweep clean the "middle layer" refers to uncovering counter-revolutionaries low in our army units and government organizations; and to sweep clean the "inner layer" refers to uncovering counter-revolutionaries lying low in our Party.
^fn3 During the 1951 Party consolidation, Party members were classified into four categories: first, those who were qualified members; second, those who were not fully qualified or had fairly serious shortcomings and who had to be remoulded and to raise their political consciousness; third, inactive and backward elements who did not measure up to the standards for Party membership; and fourth alien class elements, renegades, political speculators and degenerates who had hidden in the Party.
^fn4 "Removing rocks" was advocated by Liu Shao-chi in 1948 during the agrarian reform and Party consolidation in the liberated areas. 
He maligned large numbers of rural cadres as "rocks" weighing down on the peasants and wanted to have them removed from their posts and expelled from the Party.

^fn1 Wu Hsun (1838-96), born in Tangyi, Shantung Province, was originally a vagrant. 
Using the slogan of "schools through alms", he went about cheating people out of their money, bought land and lent money and eventually became a big landlord and usurer. 
He ganged up with despotic landlords to set up a few so-called "tuition-free schools", in which he fanatically spread feudal culture and trained lackeys for the exploiting class, thus winning praise from reactionary rulers of successive regimes.

^fn1 The movement against the "three evils" was the struggle against corruption, waste and bureaucracy launched at the end of 1951 among the personnel of government departments and state enterprises. 
The movement against the "five evils" was the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, cheating on government contracts and stealing of economic information started at the beginning of 1952 among owners of private industrial and commercial enterprises.

^fn1 Here "the transition period" refers to the period from the founding of the People's Republic of China to the basic completion of socialist transformation. 
The general line or the general task of the Party for this transition period was basically to accomplish the industrialization of China and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce over a fairly long period of time. 
This transition period is different in meaning from the transition period Comrade Mao Tsetung spoke of at the Tenth Plenary Session of the Party's Eighth Central Committee in September 1962 and thereafter, which denotes the entire historical period of transition from capitalism to communism.
^c191
^fn1 This new tax system was introduced in December 1952 and put into effect in January 1953. 
Though nominally entailing "equality between public and private enterprises", in reality it lightened the tax burdens on private industrial and commercial enterprises and increased those on state and co-operative enterprises, thus serving the interests of the capitalists at the expense of the latter. 
Soon after Comrade Mao Tsetung made his criticism, this error was corrected.
^fn2 Chang Tzu-shan was at one time secretary of the Tientsin Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. 
Corroded by the bourgeoisie, he degenerated and became a big embezzler and was sentenced to death during the movement against the "three evils".

^fn1 In its early days the Wang Kuo-fan Co-operative was woefully short of means of production, Instead of asking for state loans, the co-operative organized its members to go into the mountains some thirty li away to collect firewood which they sold to pay for means of production. 
So the co-operative members said that they "made the mountains yield" a substantial amount of the means of production.
^fn2 Here "reverse propaganda" means making clear to the masses the difficulties and adversities they may come across in forming co-operatives, in addition to publicizing the advantages and favourable conditions. 
This was done when the masses were fully aroused and applied in great numbers for co-operative membership, so that they could weigh the matter thoroughly and join of their own free will.
^fn3 The four comparisons were to compare and see which was better: (1) the co-operative, the mutual-aid team, or peasants working on their own; (2) socialism or capitalism; (3) a system with exploitation or a system without exploitation, and (4) personal enrichment or prosperity for all. 
The five calculations referred to the calculation. 
of the superiority of the co-operatives with respect to (1) coping with natural disasters, (2) increasing earnings through the promotion of side-lines, (3) increasing workpoints by arousing enthusiasm for labour, (4) increasing production as a result of mutually beneficial co-operation by the poor and the middle peasants, and (5) overcoming difficulties in production and in livelihood.

It maintained private ownership b the co-operative members of such means of production as land, draught animals an the larger farm implements, and the co-operative had to pay "dividends" to its men bets for their use. 
The elementary co-operative was therefore said to have retainssemi-private ownership.

The quotas for production fixed in that year were based on the grain yield per mou in normal years, and increases in production were not to entail extra sales of grain to the state for three years. 
The fixed quota for purchase refers to the purchase by the state of a fixed proportion of surplus grain from peasant households having a surplus. 
The fixed quota for marketing refers to the quota for the state's supply of grain to grain-deficient households. 
The system was adopted in order to raise the peasants' enthusiasm for increasing production.
^fn2 The system of obligatory sales enforced in the Soviet Union from 1933 to 1957 was the principal measure by which the state bought agricultural products.

^fn1 The payment of a fixed rate of interest was a means employed by the state in the course of socialist transformation to implement its policy of redemption with regard to the national bourgeoisie's means of production. 
After the conversion of capitalist industry and commerce into joint state-private enterprises by whole trades in 1956, the state paid the national bourgeoisie a fixed annual rate of interest on the money value of their assets for a given period of time. 
In its nature this interest was still a form of exploitation.

^fn6 In March 1926, during the war between Feng Yu-hsiang's National Army and the northeastern warlord Chang Tso-lin, the Japanese imperialists brazenly sent naval vessels to provide cover for Chang's troops who were attacking Feng's troops stationed at Taku Port. 
Thwarted, the Japanese aggressors, working hand in glove with seven other countries including Britain and the United States, sent the Chinese government an ultimatum, with insolent demands such as that for the dismantling of the defence works at Taku Port. 
On March 18, thousands of Peking workers, students and citizens held a protest rally in front of Tien An Men and started a demonstration. 
When the demonstrators reached the government building and demanded the rejection of the eight-power ultimatum, Tuan Chi-jui, the chief of the Northern warlord government, ordered the guards to fire and the demonstrators were slaughtered in cold blood.
